Reverseindex Example Application Readme
Last revised 15th April 2007


1. Application Overview
-----------------------

The reverseindex application constructs a reverse-index of links to the html 
pages that they appear in. It is able to recursively traverse a collection of
folders that contain html files and extract <a href> tags from html pages to
build the reverse-index.

2. Provided Files
-----------------

reverseindex.c: The version of the file that uses the MapReduce engine
reverseindex-seq.c: The sequential version of the application
reverseindex-pthread.c: The pthread version of the application
stddefines.h: Contains declarations of commonly used functions and constants
MapReduceScheduler.c/h: The MapReduce engine used by the application
Makefile: Compiles all 3 versions of the application
datafiles/*: Collection of folders that contain html files that can be used as 
             input to this application
README: This file


3. Running the Application
--------------------------

run 'make' to compile all 3 versions of the application. 

./reverseindex <path_to_html_collection>
./reverseindex-pthread <path_to_html_collection>
./reverseindex-seq <path_to_html_collection>

runs the MapReduce, Pthreads and sequential version of the application
respectively
