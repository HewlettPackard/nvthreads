PCA Example Application Readme
Last revised May 27, 2009


1. Application Overview
-----------------------

The PCA application computes the mean vector and covariance matrix for a 
randomly generated matrix, which is the first step in performing principal 
component analysis. 


2. Provided Files
-----------------

pca.c: The version of the file that uses the MapReduce engine
pca-seq.c: The sequential version of the application
pca-pthread.c: The Pthreads version of the application
Makefile: Compiles all 3 versions of the application
README: This file


3. Running the Application
--------------------------

Run 'make' to compile all 3 versions of the application. 

./pca -r <num_rows> -c <num_cols> -s <max value>
./pca-seq -r <num_rows> -c <num_cols> -s <max value>
./pca-pthread -r <num_rows> -c <num_cols> -s <max value>

runs the MapReduce, sequential, and Pthreads version of the application,
respectively.
