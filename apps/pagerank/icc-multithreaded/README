Simple Google PageRank algorithm implementation on artificial data written in good old C.
There are 3 branches of this project, each devoted to different parallelization technique:
- openMP
- openMPI
- Pthreads.
I did this for fun, to take a closer look at PageRank and how to parallelize it. Enjoy.
