   `adb' specifies the abstract database object.
   `name' specifies the name of the database.  If it is "*", the database will be an on-memory
   hash database.  If it is "+", the database will be an on-memory tree database.  If its suffix
   is ".tch", the database will be a hash database.  If its suffix is ".tcb", the database will
   be a B+ tree database.  If its suffix is ".tcf", the database will be a fixed-length database.
   If its suffix is ".tct", the database will be a table database.  Otherwise, this function
   fails.  Tuning parameters can trail the name, separated by "#".  Each parameter is composed of
   the name and the value, separated by "=".  On-memory hash database supports "bnum", "capnum",
   and "capsiz".  On-memory tree database supports "capnum" and "capsiz".  Hash database supports
   "mode", "bnum", "apow", "fpow", "opts", "rcnum", "xmsiz", and "dfunit".  B+ tree database
   supports "mode", "lmemb", "nmemb", "bnum", "apow", "fpow", "opts", "lcnum", "ncnum", "xmsiz",
   and "dfunit".  Fixed-length database supports "mode", "width", and "limsiz".  Table database
   supports "mode", "bnum", "apow", "fpow", "opts", "rcnum", "lcnum", "ncnum", "xmsiz", "dfunit",
   and "idx".
   If successful, the return value is true, else, it is false.
   The tuning parameter "capnum" specifies the capacity number of records.  "capsiz" specifies
   the capacity size of using memory.  Records spilled the capacity are removed by the storing
   order.  "mode" can contain "w" of writer, "r" of reader, "c" of creating, "t" of truncating,
   "e" of no locking, and "f" of non-blocking lock.  The default mode is relevant to "wc".
   "opts" can contains "l" of large option, "d" of Deflate option, "b" of BZIP2 option, and "t"
   of TCBS option.  "idx" specifies the column name of an index and its type separated by ":".
   For example, "casket.tch#bnum=1000000#opts=ld" means that the name of the database file is
   "casket.tch", and the bucket number is 1000000, and the options are large and Deflate. */
