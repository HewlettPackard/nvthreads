This is the Readme file for my program
called "bandwidth".

This is a benchmark that attempts to measure
memory bandwidth. It's useful because hardware
specifications can at times leave out key facts
about a given piece of hardware. 

You could run a non-artificial benchmark and 
observe that a general performance number is lower 
on that machine, but that conceals the cause. 

So you can run this program, whose purpose is 
to help you pinpoint the cause of a 
performance problem.

Version 0.16 focuses on 64-bit assembly code, which
requires nasm 2. I have not tested 32-bit support
in version 0.16 since I don't have 32-bit Linux
at the moment, but will make sure it works for 0.17.

Version 0.15 added 32-bit assembly code, and
more precise reporting of bandwidth values.

Bandwidth tests:
	Level 1 cache sequential read
	Level 1 cache sequential write 
	Level 2 cache sequential read
	Level 2 cache sequential write 
	Main memory sequential read speed
	Main memory sequential write speed
	Video memory sequential read speed
	Video memory sequential write speed
	Speed of library routines memset, memcpy, bzero.

This program is provided without any warranty
and AS-IS. See the file COPYING for details.
