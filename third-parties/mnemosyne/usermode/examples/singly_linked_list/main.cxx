 * the linked list represented.
 *
 * First Run:
 *   my_counter : dead0001
 *   There were 0 messages and 0 people stored here.
 *       People: [/]
 *     Messages: [/]
 *
 * Second Run:
 *   my_counter : dead0002
 *   There were 2 messages and 1 people stored here.
 *       People: [2114] -> [/]
 *     Messages: [42] -> [89] -> [/]
