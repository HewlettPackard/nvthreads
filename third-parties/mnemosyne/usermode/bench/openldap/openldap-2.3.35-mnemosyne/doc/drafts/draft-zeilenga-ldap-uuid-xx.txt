INTERNET-DRAFT               LDAP entryUUID                 18 July 2005


  This document describes the LDAP/X.500 'entryUUID' operational
  attribute and associated matching rules and syntax.  The attribute
  holds a server-assigned Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) for the
  object.  Directory clients may use this attribute to distinguish
  objects identified by a distinguished name or to locate an object
  after renaming.


1. Background and Intended Use

  In X.500 Directory Services [X.501], such as those accessible using
  the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) [Roadmap], an object
  is identified by its distinguished name (DN).  However, DNs are not
  stable identifiers.  That is, a new object may be identified by a DN
  which previously identified another (now renamed or deleted) object.

  A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is "an identifier unique across
  both space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs"
  [UUIDURN].  UUIDs are used in a wide range of systems.

  This document describes the 'entryUUID' operational attribute which
  holds the UUID assigned to the object by the server.  Clients may use
  this attribute to distinguish objects identified by a particular
  distinguished name or to locate a particular object after renaming.

  This document defines the UUID syntax, the 'uuidMatch' and
  'uuidOrderingMatch' matching rules, and the 'entryUUID' attribute
  type.

  Schema definitions are provided using LDAP description formats
  [Models].  Definitions provided here are formatted (line wrapped) for
  readability.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].


2. UUID Schema Elements

2.1 UUID Syntax

  A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) [UUIDURN] is a 16-octet
  (128-bit) value which identifies an object.  The ASN.1 [X.680] type
  UUID is defined to represent UUIDs as follows:

      UUID ::= OCTET STRING (SIZE(16))
            -- constrained to an UUID [UUIDURN]



Zeilenga               draft-zeilenga-ldap-uuid-06              [Page 2]

INTERNET-DRAFT               LDAP entryUUID                 18 July 2005


  In LDAP, UUID values are encoded using the [ASCII] character string
  representation described in [UUIDURN].  For example,
  "597ae2f6-16a6-1027-98f4-d28b5365dc14".

  The following is a LDAP syntax description suitable for publication in
  subschema subentries.

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1 DESC 'UUID' )


2.2 'uuidMatch' Matching Rule

  The 'uuidMatch' matching rule compares an asserted UUID with a stored
  UUID for equality.  Its semantics are same as the 'octetStringMatch'
  [X.520][Syntaxes] matching rule.   The rule differs from
  'octetStringMatch' in that the assertion value is encoded using the
  UUID string representation instead of the normal OCTET STRING string
  representation.

  The following is a LDAP matching rule description suitable for
  publication in subschema subentries.

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2 NAME 'uuidMatch'
          SYNTAX IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1 )


2.3 'uuidOrderingMatch' Matching Rule

  The 'uuidOrderingMatch' matching rule compares an asserted UUID
  with a stored UUID for ordering.  Its semantics are the same as the
  'octetStringOrderingMatch' [X.520][Syntaxes] matching rule.  The
  rule differs from 'octetStringOrderingMatch' in that the assertion
  value is encoded using the UUID string representation instead of
  the normal OCTET STRING string representation.

  The following is a LDAP matching rule description suitable for
  publication in subschema subentries.

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.3 NAME 'uuidOrderingMatch'
          SYNTAX IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1 )

  It is noted that not all UUID variants have a defined ordering and,
  even where so, servers are not obligated to assign UUIDs in any
  particular order.  This matching rule is provided for completeness.


2.4. 'entryUUID' attribute

INTERNET-DRAFT               LDAP entryUUID                 18 July 2005


  The 'entryUUID' operational attribute provides the Universally Unique
  Identifier (UUID) assigned to the entry.

  The following is a LDAP attribute type description suitable for
  publication in subschema subentries.

      ( IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.4 NAME 'entryUUID'
          DESC 'UUID of the entry'
          EQUALITY uuidMatch
          ORDERING uuidOrderingMatch
          SYNTAX IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1
          SINGLE-VALUE
          NO-USER-MODIFICATION
          USAGE directoryOperation )

  Servers SHALL generate and assign a new UUID to each entry upon its
  addition to the directory and provide that UUID as the value of the
  'entryUUID' operational attribute.  An entry's UUID is immutable.

  UUID are to be generated in accordance with Section 4 of [UUIDURN].
  In particular, servers MUST ensure that each generated UUID is unique
  in space and time.


3. Security Considerations

  An entry's relative distinguish name (RDN) is composed from attribute
  values of the entry, values which are commonly descriptive of the
  object the entry represents.  While deployers are encouraged to use
  naming attributes whose values are widely disclosable [LDAPDN],
  entries are often named using information which cannot be disclosed to
  all parties.  As UUIDs do not contain any descriptive information of
  the object they identify, UUIDs may be used to identify a particular
  entry without disclosure of its contents.

  General UUID security considerations [UUIDURN] apply.

  General LDAP security considerations [RFC3377] apply.


4. IANA Considerations

  It is requested that IANA register upon Standards Action the LDAP
  values specified in this document.
