INTERNET-DRAFT      draft-zeilenga-ldap-readentry-04    10 February 2005


Abstract

  This document specifies an extension to the Lightweight Directory
  Access Protocol (LDAP) to allow the client to read the target entry of
  an update operation.  The client may request to read the entry before
  and/or after the modifications are applied.  These reads are done as
  an atomic part of the update operation.


1. Background and Intent of Use

  This document specifies an extension to the Lightweight Directory
  Access Protocol (LDAP) [Roadmap] to allow the client to read the
  target entry of an update operation (e.g., Add, Delete, Modify,
  ModifyDN).  The extension utilizes controls [Protocol] attached to
  update requests to request and return copies of the target entry.  One
  request control, called the Pre-Read request control, indicates that a
  copy of the entry before application of update is to be returned.
  Another control, called the Post-Read request control, indicates that
  a copy of the entry after application of the update is to be returned.
  Each request control has a corresponding response control used to
  return the entry.

  To ensure proper isolation, the controls are processed as an atomic
  part of the update operation.

  The functionality offered by these controls is based upon similar
  functionality in the X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP) [X.511].

  The Pre-Read controls may be used to obtain replaced or deleted values
  of modified attributes or a copy of the entry being deleted.

  The Post-Read controls may be used to obtain values of operational
  attributes, such as the 'entryUUID' [EntryUUID] and 'modifyTimestamp'
  [Models] attributes, updated by the server as part of the update
  operation.


2. Terminology

  Protocol elements are described using ASN.1 [X.680] with implicit
  tags.  The term "BER-encoded" means the element is to be encoded using
  the Basic Encoding Rules [X.690] under the restrictions detailed in
  Section 5.2 of [Protocol].

  DN stands for Distinguished Name.
  DSA stands for Directory System Agent (i.e., a directory server).
  DSE stands for DSA-specific Entry.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].


3. Read Entry Controls

3.1. The Pre-Read Controls

  The Pre-Read request and response controls are identified by the
  IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1 object identifier.  Servers implementing these
  controls SHOULD publish IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1 as a value of the
  'supportedControl' [Models] in their root DSE.

  The Pre-Read request control is an LDAP Control [Protocol] whose
  controlType is IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1 and whose controlValue is a
  BER-encoded AttributeSelection [Protocol], as extended by [RFC3673].
  The criticality may be TRUE or FALSE.  This control is appropriate for
  the modifyRequest, delRequest, and modDNRequest LDAP messages.

  The corresponding response control is a LDAP Control whose controlType
  is IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.1 and whose the controlValue, an OCTET STRING,
  contains a BER-encoded SearchResultEntry.  The criticality may be TRUE
  or FALSE.  This control is appropriate for the modifyResponse,
  delResponse, and modDNResponse LDAP messages with a resultCode of
  success (0).

  When the request control is attached to an appropriate update LDAP
  request, the control requests the return of a copy of target entry
  prior to the application of the update.  The AttributeSelection
  indicates, as discussed in [Protocol][RFC3673] which attributes are
  requested to appear in the copy.  The server is to return a
  SearchResultEntry containing, subject to access controls and other
  constraints, values of the requested attributes.

  The normal processing of the update operation and the processing of
  this control MUST be performed as one atomic action isolated from
  other update operations.

  If the update operation fails (in either normal or control
  processing), no response control is provided.


3.2. The Post-Read Controls

  The Post-Read request and response controls are identified by the
  IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2 object identifier.  Servers implementing these
  controls SHOULD publish IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2 as a value of the

INTERNET-DRAFT      draft-zeilenga-ldap-readentry-04    10 February 2005


  'supportedControl' [Models] in their root DSE.

  The Post-Read request control is an LDAP Control [Protocol] whose
  controlType is IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2 and whose controlValue, an OCTET
  STRING, contains a BER-encoded AttributeSelection [Protocol], as
  extended by [RFC3673].  The criticality may be TRUE or FALSE.  This
  control is appropriate for the addRequest, modifyRequest, and
  modDNRequest LDAP messages.

  The corresponding response control is a LDAP Control whose controlType
  is IANA-ASSIGNED-OID.2 and whose controlValue is a BER-encoded
  SearchResultEntry.  The criticality may be TRUE or FALSE.  This
  control is appropriate for the addResponse, modifyResponse, and
  modDNResponse LDAP messages with a resultCode of success (0).

  When the request control is attached to an appropriate update LDAP
  request, the control requests the return of a copy of target entry
  after the application of the update.  The AttributeSelection
  indicates, as discussed in [Protocol][RFC3673], which attributes are
  requested to appear in the copy.  The server is to return a
  SearchResultEntry containing, subject to access controls and other
  constraints, values of the requested attributes.

  The normal processing of the update operation and the processing of
  this control MUST be performed as one atomic action isolated from
  other update operations.

  If the update operation fails (in either normal or control
  processing), no response control is provided.


4. Interaction with other controls

  The Pre-Read and Post-Read controls may be combined with each other
  and/or with a variety of other controls.  When combined with the
  assertion control [Assertion] and/or the manageDsaIT control
  [RFC3296], the semantics of each control included in the combination
  apply.  The Pre-Read and Post-Read controls may be combined with other
  controls as detailed in other technical specifications.


5. Security Considerations

  The controls defined in this document extend update operations to
  support read capabilities.  Servers MUST ensure that the client is
  authorized both for reading of the information provided in this
  control in addition to ensuring the client is authorized to perform
  the requested directory update.

  Security considerations for the update operations [Protocol] extended
  by this control, as well as general LDAP security considerations
  [Roadmap], generally apply to implementation and use of this extension
