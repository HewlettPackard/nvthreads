INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-zeilenga-ldap-t-f-10.txt     10 February 2005


Abstract

  This document extends the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
  to support absolute True and False filters based upon similar
  capabilities found in X.500 directory systems.  The document also
  extends the String Representation of LDAP Search Filters to support
  these filters.


1.  Background

  The X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP) [X.511] supports absolute
  True and False assertions.  An 'and' filter with zero elements always
  evaluates to True.  An 'or' filter with zero elements always evaluates
  to False.  These filters are commonly used when requesting DSA-
  specific Entries (DSEs) which do not necessarily have 'objectClass'
  attributes.  That is, where "(objectClass=*)" may evaluate to False.

  While LDAPv2 [RFC1777][RFC3494] placed no restriction on the number of
  elements in 'and' and 'or' filter sets, the LDAPv2 string
  representation [RFC1960][RFC3494] could not represent empty 'and' and
  'or' filter sets.  Due to this, absolute True or False filters were
  (unfortunately) eliminated from LDAPv3 [Roadmap].

  This documents extends LDAPv3 to support absolute True and False
  assertions by allowing empty 'and' and 'or' in Search filters
  [Protocol] and extends the filter string representation [Filters] to
  allow empty filter lists.

  It is noted that certain search operations, such as those used to
  retrieve subschema information [Models], require use of particular
  filters.  This document does not change these requirements.

  This feature is intended to allow a more direct mapping between DAP
  and LDAP (as needed to implement DAP-to-LDAP gateways).

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].


2.  Absolute True and False Filters

  Implementations of this extension SHALL allow 'and' and 'or' choices
  with zero filter elements.

  An 'and' filter consisting of an empty set of filters SHALL evaluate
  to True.  This filter is represented by the string "(&)".

  An 'or' filter consisting of an empty set of filters SHALL evaluate to
  False.  This filter is represented by the string "(|)".

  Servers supporting this feature SHOULD publish the Object Identifier
  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.5.3 as a value of the 'supportedFeatures' [RFC3674]
  attribute in the root DSE.

  Clients supporting this feature SHOULD NOT use the feature unless they
  have knowledge the server supports it.


3.  Security Considerations

  The (re)introduction of absolute True and False filters is not
  believed to raise any new security considerations.

  Implementors of this (or any) LDAPv3 extension should be familiar with
  general LDAPv3 security considerations [Roadmap].


4.  IANA Considerations

  Registration of this feature is requested [BCP64bis].
