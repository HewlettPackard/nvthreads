H1: The Big Picture - Configuration Choices

This section gives a brief overview of various {{TERM:LDAP}} directory
configurations, and how your stand-alone LDAP server {{slapd}}(8)
fits in with the rest of the world.


H2: Local Directory Service

In this configuration, you run a {{slapd}} which provides directory
service for your local domain only. It does not interact with other
directory servers in any way. This configuration is shown in Figure 3.1.

!import "config_local.gif"; align="center"; title="Local service via slapd configuration"
FT[align="Center"] Figure 3.1: Local service configuration.

Use this configuration if you are just starting out (it's the one the
quick-start guide makes for you) or if you want to provide a local
service and are not interested in connecting to the rest of the world.
It's easy to upgrade to another configuration later if you want.


H2: Local Directory Service with Referrals

In this configuration, you run a slapd which provides directory service
for your local domain and configure it to return referrals to a
{{superior}} service capable of handling requests outside your local domain.
You may run this service yourself or use one provided to you.
This configuration is shown in Figure 3.2.

!import "config_ref.gif"; align="center"; title="Local service with referrals"

Use this configuration if you want to provide local service and 
participate in the Global Directory.


H2: Replicated Directory Service

The slurpd daemon is used to propagate changes from a master slapd
to one or more slave slapds. An example master-slave configuration
is shown in figure 3.3.

!import "config_repl.gif"; align="center"; title="Replicated Directory Services"
FT[align="Center"] Figure 3.3: Replicated Directory Services

This configuration can be used in conjunction with either of the first
two configurations in situations where a single slapd does not
provide the required reliability or availability.

H2: Distributed Local Directory Service

In this configuration, the local service is partitioned into smaller
services, each of which may be replicated, and {{glued}} together with
{{superior}} and {{subordinate}} referrals.

An example of this configuration is shown in Figure 3.4.
