slapo-auditlog \- Audit Logging overlay
.SH SYNOPSIS
ETCDIR/slapd.conf

The Audit Logging overlay can be used to record all changes on a given

and the identity of the user making the change.

For Add and Modify operations the identity comes from the modifiersName
associated with the operation. This is usually the same as the requestor's
identity, but may be set by other overlays to reflect other values.
