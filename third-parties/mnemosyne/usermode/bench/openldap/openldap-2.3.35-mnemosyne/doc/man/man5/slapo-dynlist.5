.SH NAME
slapo-dynlist \- Dynamic List overlay
.SH SYNOPSIS
ETCDIR/slapd.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B dynlist
overlay to
.BR slapd (8)
allows expansion of dynamic groups and more.
Any time an entry with a specific objectClass is being returned,
the LDAP URI-valued occurrences of a specific attribute are
expanded into the corresponding entries, and the values
of the attributes listed in the URI are added to the original
entry.
No recursion is allowed, to avoid potential infinite loops.
The resulting entry must comply with the LDAP data model, so constraints
are enforced.
For example, if a \fISINGLE-VALUE\fP attribute is listed,
only the first value results in the final entry.
The above described behavior is disabled when the \fImanageDSAit\fP
control (RFC 3296) is used.
In that case, the contents of the dynamic group entry is returned;
namely, the URLs are returned instead of being expanded.

.SH CONFIGURATION
The config directives that are specific to the
.B dynlist
overlay must be prefixed by
.BR dynlist\- ,
to avoid potential conflicts with directives specific to the underlying 
database or to other stacked overlays.

.TP
.B overlay dynlist
This directive adds the dynlist overlay to the current database,
or to the frontend, if used before any database instantiation; see
.BR slapd.conf (5)
for details.

.LP
This
.B slapd.conf
configuration option is define for the dynlist overlay. It may have multiple 
occurrences, and it must appear after the
.B overlay
directive.
.TP
.B dynlist-attrset <group-oc> <URL-ad> [<member-ad>]
The value 
.B <group-oc> 
is the name of the objectClass that triggers the dynamic expansion of the
data.

The value
.B <URL-ad>
is the name of the attributeDescription that cointains the URI that is 
expanded by the overlay; if none is present, no expansion occurs.
If the intersection of the attributes requested by the search operation 
(or the asserted attribute for compares) and the attributes listed 
in the URI is empty, no expansion occurs for that specific URI.
It must be a subtype of \fIlabeledURI\fP.

The value
.B <member-ad>
is optional; if present, the overlay behaves as a dynamic group: this
attribute will list the DN of the entries resulting from the internal search.
In this case, the <attrs> portion of the URI must be absent, and the DNs 
of all the entries resulting from the expansion of the URI are listed
as values of this attribute.
Compares that assert the value of the
.B <member-ad>
attribute of entries with 
.B <group-oc>
objectClass apply as if the DN of the entries resulting from the expansion 
of the URI were present in the 
.B <group-oc> 
entry as values of the
.B <member-ad>
attribute.
.LP
The dynlist overlay may be used with any backend, but it is mainly 
intended for use with local storage backends.
In case the URI expansion is very resource-intensive and occurs frequently
with well-defined patterns, one should consider adding a proxycache
later on in the overlay stack.

.SH EXAMPLE
This example collects all the email addresses of a database into a single
entry; first of all, make sure that slapd.conf contains the directives:

.LP
.nf
    include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
    # ...

    database <database>
    # ...

    overlay dynlist
    dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL
.fi
.LP
and that slapd loads dynlist.la, if compiled as a run-time module;
then add to the database an entry like
.LP
.nf
    dn: cn=Dynamic List,ou=Groups,dc=example,dc=com
    objectClass: groupOfURLs
    cn: Dynamic List
    memberURL: ldap:///ou=People,dc=example,dc=com?mail?sub?(objectClass=person)
.fi

If no <attrs> are provided in the URI, all (non-operational) attributes are
collected.

This example implements the dynamic group feature on the 
.B member
attribute:

.LP
.nf
    include /path/to/dyngroup.schema
    # ...

    database <database>
    # ...

    overlay dynlist
    dynlist-attrset groupOfURLs memberURL member
.fi
.LP
