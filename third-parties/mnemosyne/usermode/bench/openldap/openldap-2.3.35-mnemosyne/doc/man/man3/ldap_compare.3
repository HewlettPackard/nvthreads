ldap_compare, ldap_compare_s \- Perform an LDAP compare operation
.SH LIBRARY
OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
#include <ldap.h>
.LP
.ft B
int ldap_compare_s(ld, dn, attr, value)
.ft
LDAP *ld;
char *dn, *attr, *value;

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ldap_compare_s()
routine is used to perform an LDAP compare operation
synchronously.  It takes \fIdn\fP, the DN of the entry upon which to perform
the compare, and \fIattr\fP and \fIvalue\fP, the attribute type and value to
compare to those found in the entry.  It returns an LDAP error code, which
will be LDAP_COMPARE_TRUE if the entry contains the attribute value and
LDAP_COMPARE_FALSE if it does not.  Otherwise, some error code is returned.
.LP
The
.B ldap_compare()
routine is used to perform an LDAP compare operation
asynchronously.  It takes the same parameters as
.BR ldap_compare_s() ,
but returns the message id of the request it initiated.  The result of
the compare can be obtained by a subsequent call to
.BR ldap_result (3).
.SH ERRORS
.B ldap_compare_s()
returns an LDAP error code which can be interpreted
by calling one of
.BR ldap_perror (3)
and friends.  ldap_compare() returns
-1 if something went wrong initiating the request.  It returns the
non-negative message id of the request if things went ok.
.SH BUGS
There is no way to compare binary values, but there should be.
