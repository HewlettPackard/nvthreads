/* This file contains routines to generate a change sequence number.
 * Every add, delete, and modification is given a unique identifier
 * for use in resolving conflicts during replication operations.
 *
 * These routines are (loosly) based upon draft-ietf-ldup-model-03.txt,
 * A WORK IN PROGRESS.  The format will likely change.
 *
 * The format of a CSN string is: yyyymmddhhmmssz#s#r#c
 * where s is a counter of operations within a timeslice, r is
 * the replica id (normally zero), and c is a counter of
 * modifications within this operation.  s, r, and c are
 * represented in hex and zero padded to lengths of 6, 2, and
 * 6, respectively.
 *
 * Calls to this routine MUST be serialized with other calls
 * to gmtime().
