 * Eventually, do_admin will be the entry point for performing
 * administrative tasks.  General idea: put commands in a file
 * somewhere, send slurpd a USR2 signal.  The handler for
 * USR2 (this routine) reads the file and takes some action.
 *
 * For right now, this routine has been hijacked for debugging.  When
 * slurpd receives a USR2 signal, it will dump its replication 
 * queue to the disk file given by SLURPD_DUMPFILE.
