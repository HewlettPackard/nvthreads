INTERNET-DRAFT      LDAP: Syntaxes and Matching Rules      June 23, 2005


   Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP) directory, and whose values may be transfered in the LDAP
   protocol, has a defined syntax which constrains the structure and
   format of its values.  The comparison semantics for values of a
   syntax are not part of the syntax definition but are instead provided
   through separately defined matching rules.  Matching rules specify an
   argument, an assertion value, which also has a defined syntax.  This
   document defines a base set of syntaxes and matching rules for use in
   defining attributes for LDAP directories.

1.  Introduction

   Each attribute stored in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP) directory [ROADMAP], and whose values may be transfered in the
   LDAP protocol [PROT], has a defined syntax (i.e., data type) which
   constrains the structure and format of its values.  The comparison
   semantics for values of a syntax are not part of the syntax
   definition but are instead provided through separately defined
   matching rules.  Matching rules specify an argument, an assertion

   value, which also has a defined syntax.  This document defines a base
   set of syntaxes and matching rules for use in defining attributes for
   LDAP directories.

   Readers are advised to familiarize themselves with the Directory
   Information Models [MODELS] before reading the rest of this document.
   Section 3 provides definitions for the base set of LDAP syntaxes.
   Section 4 provides definitions for the base set of matching rules for
   LDAP.

   This document is a integral part of the LDAP technical specification
   [ROADMAP] which obsoletes the previously defined LDAP technical
   specification [RFC3377] in its entirety.

   Sections 4, 5 and 7 of RFC 2252 [RFC2252] are obsoleted by [MODELS].
   The remainder of RFC 2252 is obsoleted by this document.  Sections 6
   and 8 of RFC 2256 [RFC2256] are obsoleted by this document.  The
   remainder of RFC 2256 is obsoleted by [SCHEMA] and [MODELS].  All but
   Section 2.11 of RFC 3698 [RFC3698] is obsoleted by this document.

   A number of schema elements which were included in the previous
   revision of the LDAP technical specification are not included in this
   revision of LDAP.  Public Key Infrastructure schema elements are now
   specified in [LDAP-PKI].  Unless reintroduced in future technical
   specifications, the remainder are to be considered Historic.

   The changes with respect to RFC 2252 are described in Appendix B of
   this document.

2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and  "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
   [KEYWORD].

   Syntax definitions are written according to the <SyntaxDescription>
   ABNF [ABNF] rule specified in [MODELS], and matching rule definitions
   are written according to the <MatchingRuleDescription> ABNF rule
   specified in [MODELS], except that the syntax and matching rule
   definitions provided in this document are line-wrapped for
   readability.  When such definitions are transfered as attribute
   values in the LDAP protocol (e.g., as values of the ldapSyntaxes and
   matchingRules attributes [MODELS] respectively) then those values
   would not contain line breaks.

3.  Syntaxes

INTERNET-DRAFT      LDAP: Syntaxes and Matching Rules      June 23, 2005


   Syntax definitions constrain the structure of attribute values stored
   in an LDAP directory, and determine the representation of attribute
   and assertion values transfered in the LDAP protocol.

   Syntaxes that are required for directory operation, or that are in
   common use, are specified in this section.  Servers SHOULD recognize
   all the syntaxes listed in this document, but are not required to
   otherwise support them, and MAY recognise or support other syntaxes.
   However, the definition of additional arbitrary syntaxes is
   discouraged since it will hinder interoperability.  Client and server
   implementations typically do not have the ability to dynamically
   recognize new syntaxes.

3.1.  General Considerations

   The description of each syntax specifies how attribute or assertion
   values conforming to the syntax are to be represented when transfered
   in the LDAP protocol [PROT].  This representation is referred to as
   the LDAP-specific encoding to distinguish it from other methods of
   encoding attribute values (e.g., the Basic Encoding Rules (BER)
   encoding [BER] used by X.500 [X.500] directories).

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a given attribute syntax always
   produces octet-aligned values.  To the greatest extent possible,
   encoding rules for LDAP syntaxes should produce character strings
   that can be displayed with little or no translation by clients
   implementing LDAP.  However, clients MUST NOT assume that the
   LDAP-specific encoding of a value of an unrecognized syntax is a
   human-readable character string.  There are a few cases (e.g., the
   JPEG syntax) when it is not reasonable to produce a human-readable
   representation.

   Each LDAP syntax is uniquely identified with an object identifier
   [ASN.1] represented in the dotted-decimal format (short descriptive
   names are not defined for syntaxes).  These object identifiers are
   not intended to be displayed to users.  The object identifiers for
   the syntaxes defined in this document are summarized in Appendix A.

   A suggested minimum upper bound on the number of characters in an
   attribute value with a string-based syntax, or the number of octets
   in a value for all other syntaxes, MAY be indicated by appending the
   bound inside of curly braces following the syntax's OBJECT IDENTIFIER
   in an attribute type definition (see the <noidlen> rule in [MODELS]).
   Such a bound is not considered part of the syntax identifier.

   For example, "1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15{64}" in an attribute
   definition suggests that the directory server will allow a value of
   the attribute to be up to 64 characters long, although it may allow

   longer character strings.  Note that a single character of the
   Directory String syntax can be encoded in more than one octet since
   UTF-8 [UTF8] is a variable-length encoding.  Therefore a 64 character
   string may be more than 64 octets in length.

3.2.  Common Definitions

   The following ABNF rules are used in a number of the syntax
   definitions in Section 3.3.

      PrintableCharacter = ALPHA / DIGIT / SQUOTE / LPAREN / RPAREN /
                           PLUS / COMMA / HYPHEN / DOT / EQUALS /
                           SLASH / COLON / QUESTION / SPACE
      PrintableString    = 1*PrintableCharacter
      IA5String          = *(%x00-7F)
      SLASH              = %x2F  ; forward slash ("/")
      COLON              = %x3A  ; colon (":")
      QUESTION           = %x3F  ; question mark ("?")

   The <ALPHA>, <DIGIT>, <SQUOTE>, <LPAREN>, <RPAREN>, <PLUS>, <COMMA>,
   <HYPHEN>, <DOT>, <EQUALS> and <SPACE> rules are defined in [MODELS].

3.3.  Syntax Definitions

3.3.1.  Attribute Type Description

   A value of the Attribute Type Description syntax is the definition of
   an attribute type.  The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this
   syntax is defined by the <AttributeTypeDescription> rule in [MODELS].

      For example, the following definition of the createTimestamp
      attribute type from [MODELS] is also a value of the Attribute Type
      Description syntax (note: line breaks have been added for
      readability - they are not part of the value when transfered in
      protocol).

         ( 2.5.18.1 NAME 'createTimestamp'
            EQUALITY generalizedTimeMatch
            ORDERING generalizedTimeOrderingMatch
            SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.24
            SINGLE-VALUE NO-USER-MODIFICATION
            USAGE directoryOperation )

   The LDAP definition for the Attribute Type Description syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.3 DESC 'Attribute Type Description' )

   This syntax corresponds to the AttributeTypeDescription ASN.1 type

   from [X.501].

3.3.2.  Bit String

   A value of the Bit String syntax is a sequence of binary digits.  The
   LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is defined by the
   following ABNF:

      BitString    = SQUOTE *binary-digit SQUOTE "B"
      binary-digit = "0" / "1"

   The <SQUOTE> rule is defined in [MODELS].

      Example:
         '0101111101'B

   The LDAP definition for the Bit String syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.6 DESC 'Bit String' )

   This syntax corresponds to the BIT STRING ASN.1 type from [ASN.1].

3.3.3.  Boolean

   A value of the Boolean syntax is one of the Boolean values, true or
   false.  The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is
   defined by the following ABNF:

      Boolean = "TRUE" / "FALSE"

   The LDAP definition for the Boolean syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.7 DESC 'Boolean' )

   This syntax corresponds to the BOOLEAN ASN.1 type from [ASN.1].

3.3.4.  Country String

   A value of the Country String syntax is one of the two-character
   codes from ISO 3166 [ISO3166] for representing a country.  The
   LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is defined by the
   following ABNF:

      CountryString  = 2(PrintableCharacter)

   The <PrintableCharacter> rule is defined in Section 3.2.

      Examples:

         AU

   The LDAP definition for the Country String syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.11 DESC 'Country String' )

   This syntax corresponds to the following ASN.1 type from [X.520]:

      PrintableString (SIZE (2)) -- ISO 3166 codes only

3.3.5.  Delivery Method

   A value of the Delivery Method syntax is a sequence of items that
   indicate, in preference order, the service(s) by which an entity is
   willing and/or capable of receiving messages.  The LDAP-specific
   encoding of a value of this syntax is defined by the following ABNF:

      DeliveryMethod = pdm *( WSP DOLLAR WSP pdm )

      pdm = "any" / "mhs" / "physical" / "telex" / "teletex" /
            "g3fax" / "g4fax" / "ia5" / "videotex" / "telephone"

   The <WSP> and <DOLLAR> rules are defined in [MODELS].

   The LDAP definition for the Delivery Method syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.14 DESC 'Delivery Method' )

   This syntax corresponds to the following ASN.1 type from [X.520]:

   A value of the Directory String syntax is a string of one or more
   arbitrary characters from the Universal Character Set (UCS) [UCS].  A
   zero length character string is not permitted.  The LDAP-specific
   encoding of a value of this syntax is the UTF-8 encoding [UTF8] of
   the character string.  Such encodings conform to the following ABNF:

      DirectoryString = 1*UTF8

   The <UTF8> rule is defined in [MODELS].

      Example:
         This is a value of Directory String containing #!%#@.

   Servers and clients MUST be prepared to receive arbitrary UCS code
   points, including code points outside the range of printable ASCII
   and code points not presently assigned to any character.

   Attribute type definitions using the Directory String syntax should
   not restrict the format of Directory String values, e.g., by
   requiring that the character string conforms to specific patterns
   described by ABNF.  A new syntax should be defined in such cases.

   The LDAP definition for the Directory String syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 DESC 'Directory String' )

   This syntax corresponds to the DirectoryString parameterized ASN.1
   type from [X.520].

   The DirectoryString ASN.1 type allows a choice between the
   TeletexString, PrintableString or UniversalString ASN.1 types from
   [ASN.1].  However, note that the chosen alternative is not indicated
   in the LDAP-specific encoding of a Directory String value.

   Implementations which convert Directory String values from the
   LDAP-specific encoding to the BER encoding used by X.500 must choose
   an alternative that permits the particular characters in the string,
   and must convert the characters from the UTF-8 encoding into the
   character encoding of the chosen alternative.  When converting
   Directory String values from the BER encoding to the LDAP-specific
   encoding the characters must be converted from the character encoding
   of the chosen alternative into the UTF-8 encoding.  These conversions
   SHOULD be done in a manner consistent with the Transcode step of the
   string preparation algorithms [PREP] for LDAP.

3.3.7.  DIT Content Rule Description

   A value of the DIT Content Rule Description syntax is the definition

   of a DIT (Directory Information Tree) content rule.  The
   LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is defined by the
   <DITContentRuleDescription> rule in [MODELS].

      Example:
         ( 2.5.6.4 DESC 'content rule for organization'
            NOT ( x121Address $ telexNumber ) )

      Note: a line break has been added for readability - it is not part
      of the value.

   The LDAP definition for the DIT Content Rule Description syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.16
         DESC 'DIT Content Rule Description' )

   This syntax corresponds to the DITContentRuleDescription ASN.1 type
   from [X.501].

3.3.8.  DIT Structure Rule Description

   A value of the DIT Structure Rule Description syntax is the
   definition of a DIT structure rule.  The LDAP-specific encoding of a
   value of this syntax is defined by the <DITStructureRuleDescription>
   rule in [MODELS].

      Example:
         ( 2 DESC 'organization structure rule' FORM 2.5.15.3 )

   The LDAP definition for the DIT Structure Rule Description syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.17
         DESC 'DIT Structure Rule Description' )

   This syntax corresponds to the DITStructureRuleDescription ASN.1 type
   from [X.501].

3.3.9.  DN

   A value of the DN syntax is the (purported) distinguished name (DN)
   of an entry [MODELS].  The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this
   syntax is defined by the <distinguishedName> rule from the string
   representation of distinguished names [LDAPDN].

      Examples (from [LDAPDN]):
         UID=jsmith,DC=example,DC=net
         OU=Sales+CN=J. Smith,DC=example,DC=net
         CN=John Smith\, III,DC=example,DC=net

         CN=Lu\C4\8Di\C4\87

   The LDAP definition for the DN syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12 DESC 'DN' )

   The DN syntax corresponds to the DistinguishedName ASN.1 type from
   [X.501].  Note that a BER encoded distinguished name (as used by
   X.500) re-encoded into the LDAP-specific encoding is not necessarily
   reversible to the original BER encoding since the chosen string type
   in any DirectoryString components of the distinguished name is not
   indicated in the LDAP-specific encoding of the distinguished name
   (see Section 3.3.6).

3.3.10.  Enhanced Guide

   A value of the Enhanced Guide syntax suggests criteria, which consist
   of combinations of attribute types and filter operators, to be used
   in constructing filters to search for entries of particular object
   classes.  The Enhanced Guide syntax improves upon the Guide syntax by
   allowing the recommended depth of the search to be specified.

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is defined by
   the following ABNF:

      EnhancedGuide = object-class SHARP WSP criteria WSP
                         SHARP WSP subset
      object-class  = WSP oid WSP
      subset        = "baseobject" / "oneLevel" / "wholeSubtree"

      criteria   = and-term *( BAR and-term )
      and-term   = term *( AMPERSAND term )
      term       = EXCLAIM term /
                   attributetype DOLLAR match-type /
                   LPAREN criteria RPAREN /
                   true /
                   false
      match-type = "EQ" / "SUBSTR" / "GE" / "LE" / "APPROX"

      AMPERSAND  = %x26  ; ampersand ("&")
      EXCLAIM    = %x21  ; exclamation mark ("!")

   The <SHARP>, <WSP>, <oid>, <LPAREN>, <RPAREN>, <attributetype> and
   <DOLLAR> rules are defined in [MODELS].

   The LDAP definition for the Enhanced Guide syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.21 DESC 'Enhanced Guide' )


      Example:
         person#(sn$EQ)#oneLevel

   The Enhanced Guide syntax corresponds to the EnhancedGuide ASN.1 type
   from [X.520].  The EnhancedGuide type references the Criteria ASN.1
   type, also from [X.520].  The <true> rule above represents an empty
   "and" expression in a value of the Criteria type.  The <false> rule
   above represents an empty "or" expression in a value of the Criteria
   type.

3.3.11.  Facsimile Telephone Number

   A value of the Facsimile Telephone Number syntax is a subscriber
   number of a facsimile device on the public switched telephone
   network.  The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is
   defined by the following ABNF:

      fax-number       = telephone-number *( DOLLAR fax-parameter )
      telephone-number = PrintableString
      fax-parameter    = "twoDimensional" /
                         "fineResolution" /

                         "b4Width" /
                         "uncompressed"

   The <telephone-number> is a string of printable characters that
   complies with the internationally agreed format for representing
   international telephone numbers [E.123].  The <PrintableString> rule
   is defined in Section 3.2.  The <DOLLAR> rule is defined in [MODELS].

   The LDAP definition for the Facsimile Telephone Number syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.22 DESC 'Facsimile Telephone Number')

   The Facsimile Telephone Number syntax corresponds to the
   FacsimileTelephoneNumber ASN.1 type from [X.520].

      }

   The G3FacsimileBodyPart ASN.1 type is defined in [X.420].

3.3.13.  Generalized Time

   A value of the Generalized Time syntax is a character string
   representing a date and time.  The LDAP-specific encoding of a value
   of this syntax is a restriction of the format defined in [ISO8601],
   and is described by the following ABNF:

      GeneralizedTime = century year month day hour
                           [ minute [ second / leap-second ] ]
                           [ fraction ]
                           g-time-zone

      century = 2(%x30-39) ; "00" to "99"
      year    = 2(%x30-39) ; "00" to "99"
      month   =   ( %x30 %x31-39 ) ; "01" (January) to "09"
                / ( %x31 %x30-32 ) ; "10" to "12"

   The above ABNF allows character strings which do not represent valid
   dates (in the Gregorian calendar) and/or valid times (e.g., February
   31, 1994).  Such character strings SHOULD be considered invalid for
   this syntax.

   The time value represents coordinated universal time (equivalent to
   Greenwich Mean Time) if the "Z" form of <g-time-zone> is used,
   otherwise the value represents a local time in the time zone
   indicated by <g-differential>.  In the latter case, coordinated
   universal time can be calculated by subtracting the differential from
   the local time.  The "Z" form of <g-time-zone> SHOULD be used in
   preference to <g-differential>.

   If <minute> is omitted then <fraction> represents a fraction of an
   hour, otherwise if <second> and <leap-second> are omitted then
   <fraction> represents a fraction of a minute, otherwise <fraction>
   represents a fraction of a second.

      Examples:
         199412161032Z
         199412160532-0500

   Both example values represent the same coordinated universal time:
   10:32 AM, December 16, 1994.

   The LDAP definition for the Generalized Time syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.24 DESC 'Generalized Time' )

   This syntax corresponds to the GeneralizedTime ASN.1 type from
   [ASN.1], with the constraint that local time without a differential
   SHALL NOT be used.

3.3.14.  Guide

   A value of the Guide syntax suggests criteria, which consist of
   combinations of attribute types and filter operators, to be used in
   constructing filters to search for entries of particular object
   classes.  The Guide syntax is obsolete and should not be used for
   defining new attribute types.

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is defined by
   the following ABNF:

      Guide = [ object-class SHARP ] criteria

   The <object-class> and <criteria> rules are defined in Section
   3.3.10.  The <SHARP> rule is defined in [MODELS].

   characters, which conforms to the <IA5String> rule in Section 3.2.

   The LDAP definition for the IA5 String syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.26 DESC 'IA5 String' )

   This syntax corresponds to the IA5String ASN.1 type from [ASN.1].

3.3.16.  Integer

   A value of the Integer syntax is a whole number of unlimited
   magnitude.  The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is
   the optionally signed decimal digit character string representation
   of the number (so, for example, the number 1321 is represented by the
   character string "1321").  The encoding is defined by the following
   ABNF:

      Integer = ( HYPHEN LDIGIT *DIGIT ) / number

   The <HYPHEN>, <LDIGIT>, <DIGIT> and <number> rules are defined in
   [MODELS].

   The LDAP definition for the Integer syntax is:

                     -- JPEG File Interchange Format -- })

3.3.18.  LDAP Syntax Description

   A value of the LDAP Syntax Description syntax is the description of
   an LDAP syntax.  The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax
   is defined by the <SyntaxDescription> rule in [MODELS].

   The LDAP definition for the LDAP Syntax Description syntax is:

3.3.21.  Name and Optional UID

   A value of the Name and Optional UID syntax is the distinguished name
   [MODELS] of an entity optionally accompanied by a unique identifier
   that serves to differentiate the entity from others with an identical
   distinguished name.

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is defined by
   the following ABNF:

      NameAndOptionalUID = distinguishedName [ SHARP BitString ]

   The <BitString> rule is defined in Section 3.3.2.  The

   defined in [MODELS].

   Note that although the '#' character may occur in the string
   representation of a distinguished name, no additional escaping of
   this character is performed when a <distinguishedName> is encoded in
   a <NameAndOptionalUID>.

   syntax is defined by the <ObjectClassDescription> rule in [MODELS].

      Example:
         ( 2.5.6.2 NAME 'country' SUP top STRUCTURAL MUST c
            MAY ( searchGuide $ description ) )

   Note: a line break has been added for readability - it is not part of
   the syntax.

   The LDAP definition for the Object Class Description syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.37 DESC 'Object Class Description' )

   This syntax corresponds to the ObjectClassDescription ASN.1 type from
   [X.501].

3.3.25.  Octet String

   A value of the Octet String syntax is a sequence of zero, one or more
   arbitrary octets.  The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this
   syntax is the unconverted sequence of octets, which conforms to the
   following ABNF:

      OctetString = *OCTET

   The <OCTET> rule is defined in [MODELS].  Values of this syntax are
   not generally human-readable.

   The LDAP definition for the Octet String syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 DESC 'Octet String' )

   This syntax corresponds to the OCTET STRING ASN.1 type from [ASN.1].

3.3.26.  OID

   A value of the OID syntax is an object identifier; a sequence of two
   or more non-negative integers that uniquely identify some object or
   item of specification.  Many of the object identifiers used in LDAP
   also have IANA registered names [RFC3383].

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is defined by
   the <oid> rule in [MODELS].

      Examples:
         1.2.3.4
         cn

   The LDAP definition for the OID syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38 DESC 'OID' )

   This syntax corresponds to the OBJECT IDENTIFIER ASN.1 type from
   [ASN.1].

3.3.27.  Other Mailbox

   A value of the Other Mailbox syntax identifies an electronic mailbox,
   in a particular named mail system.  The LDAP-specific encoding of a
   value of this syntax is defined by the following ABNF:

      OtherMailbox = mailbox-type DOLLAR mailbox
      mailbox-type = PrintableString
      mailbox      = IA5String

   The <mailbox-type> rule represents the type of mail system in which
   the mailbox resides, for example "MCIMail", and <mailbox> is the
   actual mailbox in the mail system described by <mailbox-type>.  The
   <PrintableString> and <IA5String> rules are defined in Section 3.2.
   The <DOLLAR> rule is defined in [MODELS].

   The LDAP definition for the Other Mailbox syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.39 DESC 'Other Mailbox' )

   The ASN.1 type corresponding to the Other Mailbox syntax is defined
   as follows, assuming EXPLICIT TAGS:

      OtherMailbox ::= SEQUENCE {
          mailboxType  PrintableString,
          mailbox      IA5String
      }

3.3.28.  Postal Address

   A value of the Postal Address syntax is a sequence of strings of one
   or more arbitrary UCS characters, which form an address in a physical
   mail system.

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is defined by
   the following ABNF:

      PostalAddress = line *( DOLLAR line )
      line          = 1*line-char
      line-char     = %x00-23
                      / (%x5C "24")  ; escaped "$"

                      / %x25-5B
                      / (%x5C "5C")  ; escaped "\"
                      / %x5D-7F
                      / UTFMB

   Each character string (i.e., <line>) of a postal address value is
   encoded as a UTF-8 [UTF8] string except that "\" and "$" characters,
   if they occur in the string, are escaped by a "\" character followed
   by the two hexadecimal digit code for the character.  The <DOLLAR>
   and <UTFMB> rules are defined in [MODELS].

   Many servers limit the postal address to no more than six lines of no
   more than thirty characters each.

      Example:
         1234 Main St.$Anytown, CA 12345$USA
         \241,000,000 Sweepstakes$PO Box 1000000$Anytown, CA 12345$USA

   The LDAP definition for the Postal Address syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.41 DESC 'Postal Address' )

   This syntax corresponds to the PostalAddress ASN.1 type from [X.520],
   i.e.,

      PostalAddress ::= SEQUENCE SIZE(1..ub-postal-line) OF
          DirectoryString { ub-postal-string }

   The values of ub-postal-line and ub-postal-string (both integers) are
   implementation defined.  Non-normative definitions appear in [X.520].

3.3.29.  Printable String

   A value of the Printable String syntax is a string of one or more
   latin alphabetic, numeric, and selected punctuation characters as
   specified by the <PrintableCharacter> rule in Section 3.2.

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is the
   unconverted string of characters, which conforms to the
   <PrintableString> rule in Section 3.2.

      Example:
         This is a PrintableString.

   The LDAP definition for the PrintableString syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.44 DESC 'Printable String' )

   This syntax corresponds to the PrintableString ASN.1 type from
   [ASN.1].

3.3.30.  Substring Assertion

   A value of the Substring Assertion syntax is a sequence of zero, one
   or more character substrings used as an argument for substring
   extensible matching of character string attribute values, i.e., as
   the matchValue of a MatchingRuleAssertion [PROT].  Each substring is
   a string of one or more arbitrary characters from the Universal
   Character Set (UCS) [UCS].  A zero length substring is not permitted.

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is defined by
   the following ABNF:

      SubstringAssertion = [ initial ] any [ final ]

      initial  = substring
      any      = ASTERISK *(substring ASTERISK)
      final    = substring
      ASTERISK = %x2A  ; asterisk ("*")

      substring           = 1*substring-character
      substring-character = %x00-29
                            / (%x5C "2A")  ; escaped "*"
                            / %x2B-5B
                            / (%x5C "5C")  ; escaped "\"
                            / %x5D-7F
                            / UTFMB

   Each <substring> of a Substring Assertion value is encoded as a UTF-8
   [UTF8] string, except that "\" and "*" characters, if they occur in
   the substring, are escaped by a "\" character followed by the two
   hexadecimal digit code for the character.

   The Substring Assertion syntax is used only as the syntax of
   assertion values in the extensible match.  It is not used as an
   attribute syntax, or in the SubstringFilter [PROT].

   The LDAP definition for the Substring Assertion syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.58 DESC 'Substring Assertion' )

   This syntax corresponds to the SubstringAssertion ASN.1 type from
   [X.520].

   A value of the Telephone Number syntax is a string of printable
   characters that complies with the internationally agreed format for
   representing international telephone numbers [E.123].

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is the
   unconverted string of characters, which conforms to the
   <PrintableString> rule in Section 3.2.

      Examples:
         +1 512 315 0280
         +1-512-315-0280
         +61 3 9896 7830

   The LDAP definition for the Telephone Number syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.50 DESC 'Telephone Number' )

   The Telephone Number syntax corresponds to the following ASN.1 type
   from [X.520]:

      PrintableString (SIZE(1..ub-telephone-number))

   The value of ub-telephone-number (an integer) is implementation
   defined.  A non-normative definition appears in [X.520].

3.3.32.  Teletex Terminal Identifier

   A value of this syntax specifies the identifier and (optionally)
   parameters of a teletex terminal.

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is defined by
   the following ABNF:

      teletex-id = ttx-term *(DOLLAR ttx-param)
      ttx-term   = PrintableString          ; terminal identifier
      ttx-param  = ttx-key COLON ttx-value  ; parameter
      ttx-key    = "graphic" / "control" / "misc" / "page" / "private"
      ttx-value  = *ttx-value-octet

      ttx-value-octet = %x00-23
                        / (%x5C "24")  ; escaped "$"
                        / %x25-5B
                        / (%x5C "5C")  ; escaped "\"
                        / %x5D-FF

   The <PrintableString> and <COLON> rules are defined in Section 3.2.
   The <DOLLAR> rule is defined in [MODELS].

   This syntax corresponds to the TeletexTerminalIdentifier ASN.1 type
   from [X.520].

3.3.33.  Telex Number

   A value of the Telex Number syntax specifies the telex number,
   country code and answerback code of a telex terminal.

   The LDAP-specific encoding of a value of this syntax is defined by
   the following ABNF:

      telex-number  = actual-number DOLLAR country-code
                         DOLLAR answerback
      actual-number = PrintableString
      country-code  = PrintableString
      answerback    = PrintableString

   The <PrintableString> rule is defined in Section 3.2.  The <DOLLAR>
   rule is defined in [MODELS].

   The LDAP definition for the Telex Number syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.52 DESC 'Telex Number' )

   This syntax corresponds to the TelexNumber ASN.1 type from [X.520].

3.3.34.  UTC Time

   A value of the UTC Time syntax is a character string representing a
   date and time to a precision of one minute or one second.  The year
   is given as a two-digit number.  The LDAP-specific encoding of a
   value of this syntax follows the format defined in [ASN.1] for the
   UTCTime type and is described by the following ABNF:

      UTCTime         = year month day hour minute [ second ]
                           [ u-time-zone ]
      u-time-zone     = %x5A  ; "Z"
                        / u-differential
      u-differential  = ( MINUS / PLUS ) hour minute

   The <year>, <month>, <day>, <hour>, <minute>, <second> and <MINUS>
   rules are defined in Section 3.3.13.  The <PLUS> rule is defined in
   [MODELS].

   The above ABNF allows character strings which do not represent valid
   dates (in the Gregorian calendar) and/or valid times.  Such character
   strings SHOULD be considered invalid for this syntax.

   The time value represents coordinated universal time if the "Z" form
   of <u-time-zone> is used, otherwise the value represents a local
   time.  In the latter case, if <u-differential> is provided then
   coordinated universal time can be calculated by subtracting the
   differential from the local time.  The <u-time-zone> SHOULD be
   present in time values and the "Z" form of <u-time-zone> SHOULD be
   used in preference to <u-differential>.

   The LDAP definition for the UTC Time syntax is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.53 DESC 'UTC Time' )

   Note: This syntax is deprecated in favor of the Generalized Time
   syntax.

   The UTC Time syntax corresponds to the UTCTime ASN.1 type from
   [ASN.1].

4.  Matching Rules

   Matching rules are used by directory implementations to compare
   attribute values against assertion values when performing Search and
   Compare operations [PROT].  They are also used when comparing a
   purported distinguished name [MODELS] with the name of an entry.
   When modifying entries, matching rules are used to identify values to
   be deleted and to prevent an attribute from containing two equal
   values.

   Matching rules that are required for directory operation, or that are
   in common use, are specified in this section.

4.1.  General Considerations

   A matching rule is applied to attribute values through an
   AttributeValueAssertion or MatchingRuleAssertion [PROT].  The
   conditions under which an AttributeValueAssertion or
   MatchingRuleAssertion evaluates to Undefined are specified elsewhere
   [PROT].  If an assertion is not Undefined then the result of the
   assertion is the result of applying the selected matching rule.  A
   matching rule evaluates to TRUE, and in some cases Undefined, as
   specified in the description of the matching rule, otherwise it
   evaluates to FALSE.

   Each assertion contains an assertion value.  The definition of each

INTERNET-DRAFT      LDAP: Syntaxes and Matching Rules      June 23, 2005


   matching rule specifies the syntax for the assertion value.  The
   syntax of the assertion value is typically, but not necessarily, the
   same as the syntax of the attribute values to which the matching rule
   may be applied.  Note that an AssertionValue in a SubstringFilter
   [PROT] conforms to the assertion syntax of the equality matching rule
   for the attribute type rather than the assertion syntax of the
   substrings matching rule for the attribute type.  Conceptually, the
   entire SubstringFilter is converted into an assertion value of the
   substrings matching rule prior to applying the rule.

   The definition of each matching rule indicates the attribute syntaxes
   to which the rule may be applied, by specifying conditions the
   corresponding ASN.1 type of a candidate attribute syntax must
   satisfy.  These conditions are also satisfied if the corresponding
   ASN.1 type is a tagged or constrained derivative of the ASN.1 type
   explicitly mentioned in the rule description (i.e., ASN.1 tags and
   constraints are ignored in checking applicability), or an alternative
   reference notation for the explicitly mentioned type.  Each rule
   description lists as examples of applicable attribute syntaxes, the
   complete list of the syntaxes defined in this document to which the
   matching rule applies.  A matching rule may be applicable to
   additional syntaxes defined in other documents if those syntaxes
   satisfy the conditions on the corresponding ASN.1 type.

   The description of each matching rule indicates whether the rule is
   suitable for use as the equality matching rule (EQUALITY), ordering
   matching rule (ORDERING) or substrings matching rule (SUBSTR) in an
   attribute type definition [MODELS].

   Each matching rule is uniquely identified with an object identifier.
   The definition of a matching rule should not be subsequently changed.
   If a change is desirable then a new matching rule with a different
   object identifier should be defined instead.

   Servers MAY implement the wordMatch and keywordMatch matching rules,
   but SHOULD implement the other matching rules in Section 4.2.
   Servers MAY implement additional matching rules.

   Servers which implement the extensibleMatch filter SHOULD allow the
   matching rules listed in Section 4.2 to be used in the
   extensibleMatch filter and SHOULD allow matching rules to be used
   with all attribute types known to the server, where the assertion
   syntax of the matching rule is the same as the value syntax of the
   attribute.

   Servers MUST publish in the matchingRules attribute, the definitions
   of matching rules referenced by values of the attributeTypes and
   matchingRuleUse attributes in the same subschema entry.  Other

   unreferenced matching rules MAY be published in the matchingRules
   attribute.

   If the server supports the extensibleMatch filter, then the server
   MAY use the matchingRuleUse attribute to indicate the applicability
   (in an extensibleMatch filter) of selected matching rules to
   nominated attribute types.

4.2.  Matching Rule Definitions

   Nominated character strings in assertion and attribute values are
   prepared according to the string preparation algorithms [PREP] for
   LDAP when evaluating the following matching rules:

      numericStringMatch,
      numericStringSubstringsMatch,
      caseExactMatch,
      caseExactOrderingMatch,
      caseExactSubstringsMatch,
      caseExactIA5Match,
      caseIgnoreIA5Match,
      caseIgnoreIA5SubstringsMatch,
      caseIgnoreListMatch,
      caseIgnoreListSubstringsMatch,
      caseIgnoreMatch,
      caseIgnoreOrderingMatch,
      caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch,
      directoryStringFirstComponentMatch,
      telephoneNumberMatch,
      telephoneNumberSubstringsMatch and
      wordMatch.

   The Transcode, Normalize, Prohibit and Check bidi steps are the same
   for each of the matching rules.  However, the Map and Insignificant
   Character Handling steps depends on the specific rule, as detailed in
   the description of these matching rules in the sections that follow.

4.2.1.  bitStringMatch

   The bitStringMatch rule compares an assertion value of the Bit String
   syntax to an attribute value of a syntax (e.g., the Bit String
   syntax) whose corresponding ASN.1 type is BIT STRING.

   If the corresponding ASN.1 type of the attribute syntax does not have
   a named bit list [ASN.1] (which is the case for the Bit String
   syntax) then the rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the attribute
   value has the same number of bits as the assertion value and the bits
   match on a bitwise basis.

   If the corresponding ASN.1 type does have a named bit list then
   bitStringMatch operates as above except that trailing zero bits in
   the attribute and assertion values are treated as absent.

   The LDAP definition for the bitStringMatch rule is:

      ( 2.5.13.16 NAME 'bitStringMatch'
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.6 )

   The bitStringMatch rule is an equality matching rule.

4.2.2.  booleanMatch

   The booleanMatch rule compares an assertion value of the Boolean
   syntax to an attribute value of a syntax (e.g., the Boolean syntax)
   whose corresponding ASN.1 type is BOOLEAN.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the attribute value and the
   assertion value are both TRUE or both FALSE.

   The LDAP definition for the booleanMatch rule is:

      ( 2.5.13.13 NAME 'booleanMatch'
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.7 )

   The booleanMatch rule is an equality matching rule.

4.2.3.  caseExactIA5Match

   The caseExactIA5Match rule compares an assertion value of the IA5
   String syntax to an attribute value of a syntax (e.g the IA5 String
   syntax) whose corresponding ASN.1 type is IA5String.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the prepared attribute
   value character string and the prepared assertion value character
   string have the same number of characters and corresponding
   characters have the same code point.

   In preparing the attribute value and assertion value for comparison,
   characters are not case folded in the Map preparation step, and only
   Insignificant Space Handling is applied in the Insignificant
   Character Handling step.

   The LDAP definition for the caseExactIA5Match rule is:

      ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.109.114.1 NAME 'caseExactIA5Match'

   The caseExactIA5Match rule is an equality matching rule.

4.2.4.  caseExactMatch

   The caseExactMatch rule compares an assertion value of the Directory
   String syntax to an attribute value of a syntax (e.g., the Directory
   String, Printable String, Country String or Telephone Number syntax)
   whose corresponding ASN.1 type is DirectoryString or one of the
   alternative string types of DirectoryString, e.g., PrintableString
   (the other alternatives do not correspond to any syntax defined in
   this document).

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the prepared attribute
   value character string and the prepared assertion value character
   string have the same number of characters and corresponding
   characters have the same code point.

   In preparing the attribute value and assertion value for comparison,
   characters are not case folded in the Map preparation step, and only
   Insignificant Space Handling is applied in the Insignificant
   Character Handling step.

   The LDAP definition for the caseExactMatch rule is:

      ( 2.5.13.5 NAME 'caseExactMatch'
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

   The caseExactMatch rule is an equality matching rule.

4.2.5.  caseExactOrderingMatch

   The caseExactOrderingMatch rule compares an assertion value of the
   Directory String syntax to an attribute value of a syntax (e.g., the
   Directory String, Printable String, Country String or Telephone
   Number syntax) whose corresponding ASN.1 type is DirectoryString or
   one of its alternative string types.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if, and only if, in the code point
   collation order, the prepared attribute value character string
   appears earlier than the prepared assertion value character string,
   i.e., the attribute value is "less than" the assertion value.

   In preparing the attribute value and assertion value for comparison,
   characters are not case folded in the Map preparation step, and only
   Insignificant Space Handling is applied in the Insignificant
   Character Handling step.

   The caseExactSubstringsMatch rule compares an assertion value of the
   Substring Assertion syntax to an attribute value of a syntax (e.g.,
   the Directory String, Printable String, Country String or Telephone
   Number syntax) whose corresponding ASN.1 type is DirectoryString or
   one of its alternative string types.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the prepared substrings of
   the assertion value match disjoint portions of the prepared attribute
   value character string in the order of the substrings in the
   assertion value, and an <initial> substring, if present, matches the
   beginning of the prepared attribute value character string, and a
   <final> substring, if present, matches the end of the prepared
   attribute value character string.  A prepared substring matches a
   portion of the prepared attribute value character string if
   corresponding characters have the same code point.

   In preparing the attribute value and assertion value substrings for
   comparison, characters are not case folded in the Map preparation
   step, and only Insignificant Space Handling is applied in the
   Insignificant Character Handling step.

   The LDAP definition for the caseExactSubstringsMatch rule is:

   The caseIgnoreIA5Match rule compares an assertion value of the IA5
   String syntax to an attribute value of a syntax (e.g the IA5 String
   syntax) whose corresponding ASN.1 type is IA5String.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the prepared attribute
   value character string and the prepared assertion value character
   string have the same number of characters and corresponding
   characters have the same code point.

   The caseIgnoreListMatch rule compares an assertion value that is a
   sequence of strings to an attribute value of a syntax (e.g., the
   Postal Address syntax) whose corresponding ASN.1 type is a SEQUENCE
   OF the DirectoryString ASN.1 type.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the attribute value and the

   strings (by position) match according to the caseIgnoreMatch matching
   rule.

   In [X.520] the assertion syntax for this matching rule is defined to
   be:

   i.e., different from the corresponding type for the Postal Address
   syntax.  The choice of the Postal Address syntax for the assertion
   syntax of the caseIgnoreListMatch in LDAP should not be seen as
   limiting the matching rule to only apply to attributes with the
   Postal Address syntax.

   the Substring Assertion syntax to an attribute value of a syntax
   (e.g., the Postal Address syntax) whose corresponding ASN.1 type is a
   SEQUENCE OF the DirectoryString ASN.1 type.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the assertion value
   matches, per the caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch rule, the character string
   formed by concatenating the strings of the attribute value, except
   that none of the <initial>, <any>, or <final> substrings of the
   assertion value are considered to match a substring of the
   concatenated string which spans more than one of the original strings
   of the attribute value.

   Note that, in terms of the LDAP-specific encoding of the Postal
   Address syntax, the concatenated string omits the <DOLLAR> line
   separator and the escaping of "\" and "$" characters.

   The directoryStringFirstComponentMatch rule is an equality matching
   rule.  When using directoryStringFirstComponentMatch to compare two
   attribute values (of an applicable syntax), an assertion value must
   first be derived from one of the attribute values.  An assertion
   value can be derived from an attribute value by taking the first
   component of that attribute value.

4.2.15.  distinguishedNameMatch

   The distinguishedNameMatch rule compares an assertion value of the DN
   syntax to an attribute value of a syntax (e.g., the DN syntax) whose
   corresponding ASN.1 type is DistinguishedName.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the attribute value and the
   assertion value have the same number of relative distinguished names
   and corresponding relative distinguished names (by position) are the
   same.  A relative distinguished name (RDN) of the assertion value is
   the same as an RDN of the attribute value if and only if they have
   the same number of attribute value assertions and each attribute
   value assertion (AVA) of the first RDN is the same as the AVA of the
   second RDN with the same attribute type.  The order of the AVAs is
   not significant.  Also note that a particular attribute type may
   appear in at most one AVA in an RDN.  Two AVAs with the same
   attribute type are the same if their values are equal according to
   the equality matching rule of the attribute type.  If one or more of
   the AVA comparisons evaluate to Undefined and the remaining AVA
   comparisons return TRUE then the distinguishedNameMatch rule
   evaluates to Undefined.

   The generalizedTimeMatch rule compares an assertion value of the
   Generalized Time syntax to an attribute value of a syntax (e.g the
   Generalized Time syntax) whose corresponding ASN.1 type is
   GeneralizedTime.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the attribute value
   represents the same universal coordinated time as the assertion
   value.  If a time is specified with the minutes or seconds absent
   then the number of minutes or seconds (respectively) is assumed to be
   zero.

   Telephone Number syntax) whose corresponding ASN.1 type is a
   PrintableString representing a telephone number.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the prepared attribute
   value character string and the prepared assertion value character
   string have the same number of characters and corresponding
   characters have the same code point.

   In preparing the attribute value and assertion value for comparison,
   characters are case folded in the Map preparation step, and only
   telephoneNumber Insignificant Character Handling is applied in the
   Insignificant Character Handling step.

   The LDAP definition for the telephoneNumberMatch matching rule is:

      ( 2.5.13.20 NAME 'telephoneNumberMatch'
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.50 )

   The telephoneNumberMatch rule is an equality matching rule.

4.2.30.  telephoneNumberSubstringsMatch

   The telephoneNumberSubstringsMatch rule compares an assertion value
   of the Substring Assertion syntax to an attribute value of a syntax
   (e.g the Telephone Number syntax) whose corresponding ASN.1 type is a
   PrintableString representing a telephone number.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the prepared substrings of
   the assertion value match disjoint portions of the prepared attribute
   value character string in the order of the substrings in the
   assertion value, and an <initial> substring, if present, matches the
   beginning of the prepared attribute value character string, and a
   <final> substring, if present, matches the end of the prepared
   attribute value character string.  A prepared substring matches a
   portion of the prepared attribute value character string if
   corresponding characters have the same code point.

   In preparing the attribute value and assertion value substrings for
   comparison, characters are case folded in the Map preparation step,
   and only telephoneNumber Insignificant Character Handling is applied
   in the Insignificant Character Handling step.

   The LDAP definition for the telephoneNumberSubstringsMatch matching
   rule is:

      ( 2.5.13.21 NAME 'telephoneNumberSubstringsMatch'
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.58 )

   The telephoneNumberSubstringsMatch rule is a substrings matching
   rule.

4.2.31.  uniqueMemberMatch

   The uniqueMemberMatch rule compares an assertion value of the Name
   And Optional UID syntax to an attribute value of a syntax (e.g the
   Name And Optional UID syntax) whose corresponding ASN.1 type is
   NameAndOptionalUID.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the <distinguishedName>
   components of the assertion value and attribute value match according
   to the distinguishedNameMatch rule and either, the <BitString>
   component is absent from both the attribute value and assertion
   value, or the <BitString> component is present in both the attribute
   value and the assertion value and the <BitString> component of the
   assertion value matches the <BitString> component of the attribute
   value according to the bitStringMatch rule.

   Note that this matching rule has been altered from its description in
   X.520 [X.520] in order to make the matching rule commutative.  Server
   implementors should consider using the original X.520 semantics
   (where the matching was less exact) for approximate matching of
   attributes with uniqueMemberMatch as the equality matching rule.

   The LDAP definition for the uniqueMemberMatch matching rule is:

      ( 2.5.13.23 NAME 'uniqueMemberMatch'
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.34 )

   The uniqueMemberMatch rule is an equality matching rule.

4.2.32.  wordMatch

   The wordMatch rule compares an assertion value of the Directory
   String syntax to an attribute value of a syntax (e.g., the Directory
   String syntax) whose corresponding ASN.1 type is DirectoryString.

   The rule evaluates to TRUE if and only if the assertion value word
   matches, according to the semantics of caseIgnoreMatch, any word in
   the attribute value.  The precise definition of a word is
   implementation specific.

   The LDAP definition for the wordMatch rule is:

      ( 2.5.13.32 NAME 'wordMatch'
         SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.15 )

5.  Security Considerations

   In general, the LDAP-specific encodings for syntaxes defined in this

   document do not define canonical encodings.  That is, a
   transformation from an LDAP-specific encoding into some other
   encoding (e.g., BER) and back into the LDAP-specific encoding will
   not necessarily reproduce exactly the original octets of the
   LDAP-specific encoding.  Therefore an LDAP-specific encoding should
   not be used where a canonical encoding is required.

   Furthermore, the LDAP-specific encodings do not necessarily enable an
   alternative encoding of values of the Directory String and DN
   syntaxes to be reconstructed, e.g., a transformation from a
   Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) [BER] encoding to an LDAP-specific
   encoding and back to a DER encoding may not reproduce the original
   DER encoding.  Therefore LDAP-specific encodings should not be used
   where reversibility to DER is needed, e.g., for the verification of
   digital signatures.  Instead, DER or a DER-reversible encoding should
   be used.

   When interpreting security-sensitive fields, and in particular fields
   used to grant or deny access, implementations MUST ensure that any
   matching rule comparisons are done on the underlying abstract value,
   regardless of the particular encoding used.

Appendix B. Changes from RFC 2252

   This annex lists the significant differences between this
   specification and RFC 2252.

   This annex is provided for informational purposes only.  It is not a
   normative part of this specification.

   1.  The IESG Note has been removed.

   2.  The major part of Sections 4, 5 and 7 has been moved to [MODELS]
       and revised.  Changes to the parts of these sections moved to
       [MODELS] are detailed in [MODELS].

   3.  BNF descriptions of syntax formats have been replaced by ABNF
       [ABNF] specifications.

   4.  The ambiguous statement in RFC 2252, Section 4.3 regarding the
       use of a backslash quoting mechanism to escape separator symbols
       has been removed.  The escaping mechanism is now explicitly
       represented in the ABNF for the syntaxes where this provision
       applies.

   5.  The description of each of the LDAP syntaxes has been expanded so
       that they are less dependent on knowledge of X.500 for
       interpretation.

   6.  The relationship of LDAP syntaxes to corresponding ASN.1 type
       definitions has been made explicit.

   7.  The set of characters allowed in a <PrintableString> (formerly
       <printablestring>) has been corrected to align with the
       PrintableString ASN.1 type in [ASN.1].  Specifically, the double
       quote character has been removed and the single quote character
       and equals sign have been added.

   8.  Values of the Directory String, Printable String and Telephone
       Number syntaxes are now required to have at least one character.

   9.  The <DITContentRuleDescription>, <NameFormDescription> and
       <DITStructureRuleDescription> rules have been moved to [MODELS].

   10. The corresponding ASN.1 type for the Other Mailbox syntax has
       been incorporated from RFC 1274.

   11. A corresponding ASN.1 type for the LDAP Syntax Description syntax
       has been invented.

INTERNET-DRAFT      LDAP: Syntaxes and Matching Rules      June 23, 2005


   12. The Binary syntax has been removed because it was not adequately
       specified, implementations with different incompatible
       interpretations exist, and it was confused with the ;binary
       transfer encoding.

   13. All discussion of transfer options, including the ";binary"
       option, has been removed.  All imperatives regarding binary
       transfer of values have been removed.

   14. The Delivery Method, Enhanced Guide, Guide, Octet String, Teletex
       Terminal Identifier and Telex Number syntaxes from RFC 2256 have
       been incorporated.

   15. The <criteria> rule for the Enhanced Guide and Guide syntaxes has
       been extended to accommodate empty "and" and "or" expressions.

   16. An encoding for the <ttx-value> rule in the Teletex Terminal
       Identifier syntax has been defined.

   17. The PKI-related syntaxes (Certificate, Certificate List and
       Certificate Pair) have been removed.  They are reintroduced in
       [LDAP-PKI] (as is the Supported Algorithm syntax from RFC 2256).

   18. The MHS OR Address syntax has been removed since its
       specification (in RFC 2156) is not at draft standard maturity.

   19. The DL Submit Permission syntax has been removed as it depends on
       the MHS OR Address syntax.

   20. The Presentation Address syntax has been removed since its
       specification (in RFC 1278) is not at draft standard maturity.

   21. The ACI Item, Access Point, Audio, Data Quality, DSA Quality, DSE
       Type, LDAP Schema Description, Master And Shadow Access Points,
       Modify Rights, Protocol Information, Subtree Specification,
       Supplier Information, Supplier Or Consumer and Supplier And
       Consumer syntaxes have been removed.  These syntaxes are
       referenced in RFC 2252, but not defined.

   22. The LDAP Schema Definition syntax (defined in RFC 2927) and the
       Mail Preference syntax have been removed on the grounds that they
       are out of scope for the core specification.

   23. The description of each of the matching rules has been expanded
       so that they are less dependent on knowledge of X.500 for
       interpretation.

   24. The caseIgnoreIA5SubstringsMatch matching rule from RFC 2798 has

INTERNET-DRAFT      LDAP: Syntaxes and Matching Rules      June 23, 2005


       been added.

   25. The caseIgnoreListSubstringsMatch, caseIgnoreOrderingMatch and
       caseIgnoreSubstringsMatch matching rules have been added to the
       list of matching rules for which the provisions for handling
       leading, trailing and multiple adjoining whitespace characters
       apply (now through string preparation).  This is consistent with
       the definitions of these matching rules in X.500.  The
       caseIgnoreIA5SubstringsMatch rule has also been added to the
       list.

   26. The specification of the octetStringMatch matching rule from
       RFC 2256 has been added to this document.

   27. The presentationAddressMatch matching rule has been removed as it
       depends on an assertion syntax (Presentation Address) that is not
       at draft standard maturity.

   28. The protocolInformationMatch matching rule has been removed as it
       depends on an undefined assertion syntax (Protocol Information).

   29. The definitive reference for ASN.1 has been changed from X.208 to
       X.680 since X.680 is the version of ASN.1 referred to by X.500.

   30. The specification of the caseIgnoreListSubstringsMatch matching
       rule from RFC 2798 & X.520 has been added.

   31. String preparation algorithms have been applied to the character
       string matching rules.

   32. The specifications of the booleanMatch, caseExactMatch,
       caseExactOrderingMatch, caseExactSubstringsMatch,
       directoryStringFirstComponentMatch, integerOrderingMatch,
       keywordMatch, numericStringOrderingMatch,
       octetStringOrderingMatch and wordMatch matching rules from
       RFC 3698 & X.520 have been added.
