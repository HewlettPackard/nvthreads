INTERNET-DRAFT     draft-zeilenga-ldap-dontusecopy-02       5 March 2006


Abstract

  This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
  Don't Use Copy control extension which allows a client to specify that
  copied information should not be used in providing service.  This
  control is based upon the X.511 dontUseCopy service control option.


1.  Background and Intended Usage

  This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
  [Roadmap] Don't Use Copy control extension.  The control may be
  attached to request messages to indicate that copied (replicated or
  cached) information [X.500] should not be used in providing service.
  This control is based upon the X.511 [X.511] dontUseCopy service
  control option.

  The Don't Use Copy control is intended to be used where the client
  requires the service be provided using original (master) information
  [X.500].


2. Terminology

  DSA stands for Directory System Agent (or server).
  DSE stands for DSA-specific Entry.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].


3.  The Don't Use Copy Control

  The Don't Use Copy control is an LDAP Control [Protocol] whose
  controlType is IANA-ASSIGNED-OID and controlValue is absent.  The
  criticality MUST be TRUE.  There is no corresponding response control.

  The control is appropriate for both LDAP interrogation operations,
  including Compare and Search operations [Protocol].  It is
  inappropriate for all other operations, including Abandon, Bind,
  Delete, Modify, ModifyDN, StartTLS, and Unbind operations [Protocol].

  When the control is attached to an LDAP request, the requested
  operation MUST NOT be performed on copied information.  That is, the
  requested operation MUST be performed on original information.

  If original information for the target or base object of the operation

  is not available (either locally or through chaining), the server MUST
  either return a referral directing the client to a server believed to
  be better able to service the request or return an appropriate result
  code (e.g., unwillingToPerform).


4.  Security Considerations

  This control is intended to be provided where providing service using
  copied information might lead to unexpected application behavior.
  Designers of directory applications should consider where it is
  appropriate for clients to provide this control.  Designers should
  consider whether use of copied information, in particular security and
  policy information, may result insecure behavior.

  Security considerations for the base operations [Protocol] extended by
  this control, as well as general LDAP security considerations
  [Roadmap], generally apply to implementation and use of this
  extension.


5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Object Identifier

  It is requested that IANA assign upon Standards Action an LDAP Object
  Identifier [BCP64bis] to identify the LDAP Don't Use Copy Control
  defined in this document.
