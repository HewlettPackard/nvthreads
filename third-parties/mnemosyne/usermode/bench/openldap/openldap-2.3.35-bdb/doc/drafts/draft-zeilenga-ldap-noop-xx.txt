Abstract

  This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
  No-Op control which can be used to disable the normal effect of an
  operation.  The control can be used to discover how a server might
  react to a particular update request without updating the directory.


1.  Overview

  It is often desirable to be able to determine if a directory operation
  [Protocol] would successful complete or not without having the normal
  effect of the operation take place.  For example, an administrative
  client might want to verify that new user could update their entry
  (and not other entries) without the directory actually being updated.
  The mechanism could be used to build more sophisticated security
  auditing tools.

  This document defines the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
  [Roadmap] No-Op control extension.  The presence of the No-Op control
  in an operation request message disables its normal effect upon the
  directory which operation would otherwise have.  Instead of updating
  the directory and returning the normal indication of success, the
  server does not update the directory and indicates so by returning the
  noOperation resultCode (introduced below).

  For example, when the No-Op control is present in a LDAP modify
  operation [Protocol], the server is do all processing necessary to
  perform the operation without actually updating the directory.  If it
  detects an error during this processing, it returns a non-success
  (other than noOperation) resultCode as it normally would.  Otherwise,
  it returns the noOperation.  In either case, the directory is left
  unchanged.

  This No-Op control is not intended to be to an "effective access"
  mechanism [RFC2820, U12].


1.1.  Terminology

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].

  DN stands for Distinguished Name.
  DSA stands for Directory System Agent.
  DSE stands for DSA-specific entry.

2.  No-Op Control

  The No-Op control is an LDAP Control [Protocol] whose controlType is
  IANA-ASSIGNED-OID and controlValue is absent.  Clients MUST provide a
  criticality value of TRUE to prevent unintended modification of the
  directory.

  The control is appropriate for request messages of LDAP Add, Delete,
  Modify and ModifyDN operations [Protocol].  The control is also
  appropriate for requests of extended operations which update the
  directory (or other data stores), such as Password Modify Extended
  Operation [RFC3062].  There is no corresponding response control.

  When the control is attached to an LDAP request, the server does all
  normal processing possible for the operation without modification of
  the directory.  That is, when the control is attached to an LDAP
  request, the directory SHALL NOT be updated and the response SHALL NOT
  have a resultCode of success (0).

  A result code other than noOperation (IANA-ASSIGNED-CODE) means that
  the server is unable or unwilling to complete the processing for the
  reason indicated by the result code.  A result code of noOperation
  (IANA-ASSIGNED-CODE) indicates that the server discovered no reason
  why the operation would fail if submitted without the No-Op control.
  It is noted that there may be reasons why the operation may fail which
  are only discoverable when submitting without the No-Op control.

  Servers SHOULD indicate their support for this control by providing
  IANA-ASSIGNED-OID as a value of the 'supportedControl' attribute type
  [Models] in their root DSE entry.  A server MAY choose to advertise
  this extension only when the client is authorized to use this
  operation.


3.  Security Considerations

  The No-Op control mechanism allows directory administrators and users
  to verify that access control and other administrative policy controls
  are properly configured.  The mechanism may also lead to the
  development (and deployment) of more effective security auditing
  tools.

  Implementors of this LDAP extension should be familiar with security
  considerations applicable to the LDAP operations [Protocol] extended
  by this control, as well as general LDAP security considerations
  [Roadmap].
