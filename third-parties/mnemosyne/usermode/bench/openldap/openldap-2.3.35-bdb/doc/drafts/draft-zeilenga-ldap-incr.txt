INTERNET-DRAFT       draft-zeilenga-ldap-incr-01.txt    10 February 2005


Abstract

  This document describes an extension to the Lightweight Directory
  Access Protocol (LDAP) Modify operation to support an increment
  capability.  This extension is useful in provisioning applications,
  especially when combined with the assertion control and/or the
  pre-read or post-read control extension.


1.  Background and Intended Use

  The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol [Roadmap] does not currently
  provide an operation to increment values of an attribute.  A client
  must read the values of the attribute, then modify those values to
  increment them by the desired amount.  As the values may be updated by
  other clients between this add and modify, the client must be careful
  to construct the modify request so that it fails in this case, and
  upon failure, re-read the values and construct a new modify request.

  This document extends the LDAP Modify Operation [Protocol] to support
  an increment values capability.  This feature is intended to be used
  with either the LDAP pre-read or post-read control extension
  [ReadEntry].  This feature may also be used with the LDAP assertion
  control [Assertion] to provide test-and-increment functionality.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
  "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
  document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119].


2.  The Modify-Increment Extension

  This document extends the LDAP Modify request to support a increment
  values capability.  Implementations of this extension SHALL support an
  additional ModifyRequest operation enumeration value increment (IANA-
  ASSIGNED-TYPE) as described herein.  Implementations not supporting
  this extension will treat this value as they would an unlisted value,
  e.g., as a protocol error.

  The increment (IANA-ASSIGNED-TYPE) operation value specifies that an
  increment values modification is requested.   All existing values of
  the modification attribute are to be incremented by the listed value.
  The modification attribute must be appropriate for request, e.g., must
  have INTEGER or other increment-able values, and the modification must
  provide one and only value.   If the attribute is not appropriate for
  the request, a constraintViolation or other appropriate error is to be
  returned.  If multiple values are provided, a protocolError is to be
  returned.

  Servers supporting this feature SHOULD publish the object identifier
  (OID) IANA-ASSIGNED-OID as a value of the 'supportedFeatures'
  [RFC3674] attribute in the root DSE.  Clients supporting this feature
  SHOULD NOT use the feature unless they have knowledge the server
  supports it.


  3. LDIF Support

  To represent Modify-Increment requests in LDAP Data Interchange Format
  [RFC2849], the ABNF [RFC2234] production <mod-spec> is extended as
  follows:

      mod-spec /= "increment:" FILL AttributeDescription SEP
           attrval-spec "-" SEP

  For example,

      # Increment uidNumber
      dn: cn=max-assigned uidNumber,dc=example,dc=com
      changetype: modify
      increment: uidNumber
      uidNumber: 1
      -

  This LDIF fragment represents a Modify request to increment the
  value(s) of uidNumber by 1.


4.  Security Considerations

  General LDAP security considerations [Roadmap], as well as those
  specific to the LDAP Modify [Protocol], apply to this Modify-Increment
  extension.  Beyond these considerations, it is noted that introduction
  of this extension should reduce application complexity (by provide one
  operation what presently requires multiple operation) and, hence, may
  aide in the production of correct and secure implementations.


5.  IANA Considerations

  Registration of the following values [BCP64bis] is requested.


5.1.  Object Identifier

  It is requested that IANA assign an LDAP Object Identifier to identify
  the LDAP Modify-Increment feature as defined in this document.
