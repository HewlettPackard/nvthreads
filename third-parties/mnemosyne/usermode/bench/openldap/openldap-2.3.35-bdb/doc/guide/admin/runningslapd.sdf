H1: Running slapd

{{slapd}}(8) is designed to be run as a stand-alone server.  This allows
the server to take advantage of caching, manage concurrency issues
with underlying databases, and conserve system resources.  Running
from {{inetd}}(8) is {{NOT}} an option.


H2: Command-Line Options

{{slapd}}(8) supports a number of command-line options as detailed
in the manual page.  This section details a few commonly used options.

>	-f <filename>

This option specifies an alternate configuration file for slapd.
The default is normally {{F:/usr/local/etc/openldap/slapd.conf}}.

>	-h <URLs>

This option specifies alternative listener configurations.  The
default is {{EX:ldap:///}} which implies LDAP over TCP on all
interfaces on the default LDAP port 389.  You can specify
specific host-port pairs or other protocol schemes (such as
ldaps:// or ldapi://).  For example,
{{EX:-h "ldaps:// ldap://127.0.0.1:666"}} will create
two listeners: one for LDAP over SSL on all interfaces on
the default LDAP/SSL port 636, and one for LDAP over TCP on
the {{EX:localhost}} ({{loopback}}) interface on port 666.
Hosts may be specified using IPv4 dotted-decimal form or
using host names.  Port values must be numeric.

>	-n <service-name>

This option specifies the service name used for logging and
other purposes.  The default service name is {{EX:slapd}}.

>	-l <syslog-local-user>

This option specifies the local user for the {{syslog}}(8)
facility.  Values can be {{EX:LOCAL0}}, {{EX:LOCAL1}}, {{EX:LOCAL2}}, ...,
and {{EX:LOCAL7}}.  The default is {{EX:LOCAL4}}.  This option
may not be supported on all systems.

>	-u user -g group

These options specify the user and group, respectively, to run
as.  {{EX:user}} can be either a user name or uid.  {{EX:group}}
can be either a group name or gid.

>	-r directory

This option specifies a run-time directory.  slapd will
{{chroot}}(2) to this directory after opening listeners but
before reading any configuration files or initializing
any backends.
.

>	-d <level> | ?

This option sets the slapd debug level to <level>. When level is a
`?' character, the various debugging levels are printed and slapd
exits, regardless of any other options you give it. Current
debugging levels are

!block table; colaligns="RL"; align=Center; \
	title="Table 6.1: Debugging Levels"
Level	Description
-1	enable all debugging
0	no debugging
1	trace function calls
2	debug packet handling
4	heavy trace debugging
8	connection management
16	print out packets sent and received
32	search filter processing
64	configuration file processing
128	access control list processing
256	stats log connections/operations/results
512	stats log entries sent
1024	print communication with shell backends
2048	print entry parsing debugging
!endblock

You may enable multiple levels by specifying the debug option
once for each desired level.  Or, since debugging levels are
additive, you can do the math yourself. That is, if you want
to trace function calls and watch the config file being
processed, you could set level to the sum of those two levels
(in this case, {{EX: -d 65}}).  Or, you can let slapd do the
math, (e.g. {{EX: -d 1 -d 64}}).  Consult {{F: <ldap_log.h>}} for
more details.

Note: slapd must have been compiled with {{EX:-DLDAP_DEBUG}}
defined for any debugging information beyond the two stats levels
to be available.


H2: Starting slapd

In general, slapd is run like this:

>	/usr/local/etc/libexec/slapd [<option>]*

where {{F:/usr/local/etc/libexec}} is determined by {{EX:configure}}
and <option> is one of the options described above (or in {{slapd}}(8)).
Unless you have specified a debugging level (including level {{EX:0}}),
slapd will automatically fork and detach itself from its controlling
terminal and run in the background.

H2: Stopping slapd

To kill off slapd safely, you should give a command like this

> 	kill -INT `cat /usr/local/var/slapd.pid`

where {{F:/usr/local/var}} is determined by {{EX:configure}}.

Killing slapd by a more drastic method may cause information
loss or database corruption.
