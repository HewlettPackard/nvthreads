* Overview

  This malloc, like any other, is a compromised design. 

  Chunks of memory are maintained using a `boundary tag' method as
  described in e.g., Knuth or Standish.  The size of the chunk is
  stored both in the front of the chunk and at the end.  This makes
  consolidating fragmented chunks into bigger chunks very fast.  The
  size field also hold a bit representing whether a chunk is free or
  in use.

  Malloced chunks have space overhead of 8 bytes: The preceding and
  trailing size fields.  When a chunk is freed, 8 additional bytes are
  needed for free list pointers. Thus, the minimum allocatable size is
  16 bytes.  8 byte alignment is currently hardwired into the design.
  This seems to suffice for all current machines and C compilers.
  Calling memalign will return a chunk that is both 8-byte aligned
  and meets the requested (power of two) alignment.

  It is assumed that 32 bits suffice to represent chunk sizes.  The
  maximum size chunk is 2^31 - 8 bytes.  malloc(0) returns a pointer
  to something of the minimum allocatable size.  Requests for negative
  sizes (when size_t is signed) or with the highest bit set (when
  unsigned) will also return a minimum-sized chunk.

  Available chunks are kept in doubly linked lists. The lists are
  maintained in an array of bins using a power-of-two method, except
  that instead of 32 bins (one for each 1 << i), there are 128: each
  power of two is split in quarters.  Chunk sizes up to 128 are
  treated specially; they are categorized on 8-byte boundaries.  This
  both better distributes them and allows for special faster
  processing.

  The use of very fine bin sizes closely approximates the use of one
  bin per actually used size, without necessitating the overhead of
  locating such bins. It is especially desirable in common
  applications where large numbers of identically-sized blocks are
  malloced/freed in some dynamic manner, and then later are all freed.
  The finer bin sizes make finding blocks fast, with little wasted
  overallocation. The consolidation methods ensure that once the
  collection of blocks is no longer useful, fragments are gathered
  into bigger chunks awaiting new roles.

  The bins av[i] serve as heads of the lists. Bins contain a dummy
  header for the chunk lists. Each bin has two lists. The `dirty' list
  holds chunks that have been returned (freed) and not yet either
  re-malloc'ed or consolidated. (A third free-standing list contains
  returned chunks that have not yet been processed at all.) The `clean'
  list holds split-off fragments and consolidated space. All
  procedures maintain the invariant that no clean chunk physically
  borders another clean chunk. Thus, clean chunks never need to be
  scanned during consolidation.

* Algorithms

  Malloc:

    This is a very heavily disguised first-fit algorithm.
    Most of the heuristics are designed to maximize the likelihood
    that a usable chunk will most often be found very quickly,
    while still minimizing fragmentation and overhead.

    The allocation strategy has several phases:

      0. Convert the request size into a usable form. This currently
         means to add 8 bytes overhead plus possibly more to obtain
         8-byte alignment. Call this size `nb'.

      1. Check if the last returned (free()'d) or preallocated chunk
         is of the exact size nb. If so, use it.  `Exact' means no
         more than MINSIZE (currently 16) bytes larger than nb. This
         cannot be reduced, since a chunk with size < MINSIZE cannot
         be created to hold the remainder.

         This check need not fire very often to be effective.  It
         reduces overhead for sequences of requests for the same
         preallocated size to a dead minimum.

      2. Look for a dirty chunk of exact size in the bin associated
         with nb.  `Dirty' chunks are those that have never been
         consolidated.  Besides the fact that they, but not clean
         chunks require scanning for consolidation, these chunks are
         of sizes likely to be useful because they have been
         previously requested and then freed by the user program.

         Dirty chunks of bad sizes (even if too big) are never used
         without consolidation. Among other things, this maintains the
         invariant that split chunks (see below) are ALWAYS clean.

         2a If there are dirty chunks, but none of the right size,
             consolidate them all, as well as any returned chunks
             (i.e., the ones from step 3). This is all a heuristic for
             detecting and dealing with excess fragmentation and
             random traversals through memory that degrade
             performance especially when the user program is running
             out of physical memory.

      3. Pull other requests off the returned chunk list, using one if
         it is of exact size, else distributing into the appropriate
         bins.

      4. Try to use the last chunk remaindered during a previous
         malloc. (The ptr to this chunk is kept in var last_remainder,
         to make it easy to find and to avoid useless re-binning
         during repeated splits.  The code surrounding it is fairly
         delicate. This chunk must be pulled out and placed in a bin
         prior to any consolidation, to avoid having other pointers
         point into the middle of it, or try to unlink it.) If
         it is usable, proceed to step 9.

      5. Scan through clean chunks in the bin, choosing any of size >=
         nb. Split later (step 9) if necessary below.  (Unlike in step
         2, it is good to split here, because it creates a chunk of a
         known-to-be-useful size out of a fragment that happened to be
         close in size.)

      6. Scan through the clean lists of all larger bins, selecting
         any chunk at all. (It will surely be big enough since it is
         in a bigger bin.)  The scan goes upward from small bins to
         large.  It would be faster downward, but could lead to excess
         fragmentation. If successful, proceed to step 9.

      7. Consolidate chunks in other dirty bins until a large enough
         chunk is created. Break out to step 9 when one is found.

         Bins are selected for consolidation in a circular fashion
         spanning across malloc calls. This very crudely approximates
         LRU scanning -- it is an effective enough approximation for
         these purposes.

      8. Get space from the system using sbrk.

         Memory is gathered from the system (via sbrk) in a way that
         allows chunks obtained across different sbrk calls to be
         consolidated, but does not require contiguous memory. Thus,
         it should be safe to intersperse mallocs with other sbrk
         calls.

      9. If the selected chunk is too big, then:

         9a If this is the second split request for nb bytes in a row,
             use this chunk to preallocate up to MAX_PREALLOCS
             additional chunks of size nb and place them on the
             returned chunk list.  (Placing them here rather than in
             bins speeds up the most common case where the user
             program requests an uninterrupted series of identically
             sized chunks. If this is not true, the chunks will be
             binned in step 3 next time.)

         9b Split off the remainder and place in last_remainder.
             Because of all the above, the remainder is always a
             `clean' chunk.

     10.  Return the chunk.


  Free: 
    Deallocation (free) consists only of placing the chunk on a list
    of returned chunks. free(0) has no effect.  Because freed chunks
    may be overwritten with link fields, this malloc will often die
    when freed memory is overwritten by user programs.  This can be
    very effective (albeit in an annoying way) in helping users track
    down dangling pointers.

  Realloc:
    Reallocation proceeds in the usual way. If a chunk can be extended,
    it is, else a malloc-copy-free sequence is taken. 

  Memalign, valloc:
    memalign arequests more than enough space from malloc, finds a spot
    within that chunk that meets the alignment request, and then
    possibly frees the leading and trailing space. Overreliance on
    memalign is a sure way to fragment space.

* Other implementation notes

  This malloc is NOT designed to work in multiprocessing applications.
  No semaphores or other concurrency control are provided to ensure
  that multiple malloc or free calls don't run at the same time, which
  could be disasterous. A single semaphore could be used across malloc,
  realloc, and free. It would be hard to obtain finer granularity.

  The implementation is in straight, hand-tuned ANSI C.  Among other
  consequences, it uses a lot of macros. These would be nicer as
  inlinable procedures, but using macros allows use with non-inlining
  compilers, and also makes it a bit easier to control when they
  should be expanded out by selectively embedding them in other macros
  and procedures. (According to profile information, it is almost, but
  not quite always best to expand.)

/* TUNABLE PARAMETERS */

/* 
  SBRK_UNIT is a good power of two to call sbrk with It should
  normally be system page size or a multiple thereof.  If sbrk is very
  slow on a system, it pays to increase this.  Otherwise, it should
  not matter too much.
*/

#define SBRK_UNIT 8192

/* 
  MAX_PREALLOCS is the maximum number of chunks to preallocate.  The
  actual number to prealloc depends on the available space in a
  selected victim, so typical numbers will be less than the maximum.
  Because of this, the exact value seems not to matter too much, at
  least within values from around 1 to 100.  Since preallocation is
  heuristic, making it too huge doesn't help though. It may blindly
  create a lot of chunks when it turns out not to need any more, and
  then consolidate them all back again immediatetly. While this is
  pretty fast, it is better to avoid it.

  Funny-looking mechanics:

        usually much less.) After the loop, the remainder is quartered
