 * This code is poorly documented.

/*
 * Overview of this vistaheap management system
 *
 *	This vistaheap is designed to be fast, small, and to let vistaheap metadata
 * 	live anywhere the user likes. The memory it provides the user comes
 *	from a file mapped into the process' address space with mmap().
 *	This vistaheap automatically extends the end of the file (and vistaheap) as
 *	user needs grow. It makes no attempt to shorten the file as user
 *	needs shrink however. It also never unmaps any portion of the vistaheap
 *	to return memory to the system.
 *	
 *	All memory requests are quantized to the nearest power of two size.
 *	The smallest allocatable size is eight bytes. For example, a request 
 *	for 150k results in 256k being returned to the user. All allocations 
 *	are at least quadword (8 bytes) aligned. Those allocations that are 
 *	8k or more in size are page aligned. 
 *
 *	This vistaheap's routines are extremely fast, at a cost of being somewhat
 *	extravagant in its space usage. This vistaheap does not keep track of 
 *	the size of each allocation as most vistaheaps do (for example, by 
 *	storing the size of the allocation just before the start of the 
 *	returned chunk of memory). Therefore the size of each allocation 
 *	needs to be passed to the vistaheap_free() routine when the allocation
 *	is returned to the vistaheap. Although this is a little more work than
 * 	one usually has to do with a vistaheap, the size of each allocation is 
 *	usually known statically. We impose this constraint because keeping
 *	the size of each allocation with the users chunk of memory 
 *	essentially puts vistaheap metadata in a location in which it could be
 *	readily corrupted by the user. The alternative might be to keep 
 *	some sort of hash table for this information, but that might add
 *	significantly to the overhead of this extremely lightweight package.
