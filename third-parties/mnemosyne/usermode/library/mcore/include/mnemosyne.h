 * \file
 * Defines the public interface to the mnemosyne persistent memory allocator. Having this
 * header, one is able to map persistent segments and allocate memory from them safely. One
 * may use persistent globals to point to these dynamic segments. All persistent segments will
 * be automatically reincarnated on every process startup without intervention by the
 * application programmer.
 *
 * Library implementors making use of Mnemosyne transactional memory will appreciate the 
 * reincarnation callback functionality. This functionality allows the implementor to
 * attach his own initializations to be run after persistent segments are guaranteed
 * to have been mapped back into the process.
