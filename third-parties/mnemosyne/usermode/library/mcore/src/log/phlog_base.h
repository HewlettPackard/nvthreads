/**
 * \file
 * 
 * \brief Simple base physical log.
 *
 * INVARIANTS:
 *
 * 1. Head and tail always advance by the number of buffer entries.
 *    
 *    For example if cache-line size is 64 bytes and word is 64-bits,
 *    then the buffer has 8 entries to ensuere that there would always
 *    be a complete cacheline to write to the hardware WC buffer. 
 *    Since buffer has 8 entries, we advance head and tail by 8 entries
 *    as well. In the case when we flush the log, the buffer might not
 *    be full. We still flush 8 entries even if the buffer is full and
 *    we advance tail by 8. This simplifies and makes bounds checking
 *    faster by requiring less conditions (less branches, no-memory fences).
 *
 * 2. todo: state the rest of the invariants
 *
 * TERMINOLOGY:
 *
 * Atomic log fragment: a region of the log guaranteed to be made persistent.
 *
