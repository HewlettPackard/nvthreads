Linear Regression Example Application Readme
Last revised May 27, 2009


1. Application Overview
-----------------------

The Linear Regression application generates the summary statistics of points to 
give the linear approximation of all the points. It reads the x-y coordinates
sequentially from the specified file.


2. Provided Files
-----------------

linear_regression.c: The version of the file that uses the MapReduce engine
linear_regression-seq.c: The sequential version of the application
linear_regression-pthread.c: The Pthreads version of the application
Makefile: Compiles all 3 versions of the application
datafiles/key_file*.txt: Files of various sizes that contain input coordinates (download from the website)
README: This file


3. Running the Application
--------------------------

Run 'make' to compile all 3 versions of the application. 

./linear_regression <file-name>
./linear_regression-seq <file-name>
./linear_regression-pthread <file-name>

runs the MapReduce, sequential, and Pthreads version of the application,
respectively.


End File
