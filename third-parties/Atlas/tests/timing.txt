# Use the data in this file to detect whether the performance of a
# program has changed significantly. This is done by comparing the
# runtime of the nvram-version of a program with its transient
# version. The runtime ratio should be within a range.
# Let R = <nvram-version-runtime> / <transient-version-runtime>
# Here's the format (1 line per program):
# <transient pgm_name> <nvram pgm_name> <R.lower-bound> <R.upper-bound>
