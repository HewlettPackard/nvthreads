Changes were made to adapt the hashtable to use persistent memory.

The logic has changed. If the program finds an existing persistent
hashtable, it will use it and insert a certain number of elements
to start with. Additionally, not all the elements are removed in
a given pass.

Do not build old_tester since the appropriate persistent memory
modifications haven't been done for that part of the code.

The tester can be built from the makefile in the Atlas root directory.
