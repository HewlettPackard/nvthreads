Thanks to Glenn Lawyer for pointing out a Makefile fix for the tester example 
code.

Thanks to Holger Schemel for reminding me to actually free the hashtable in the 
destroy function...
Also for the hashtable_change function, now found in the hashtable utility 
source.

Thanks to John Muehlhausen for the iterator bug report - fixed 2003-03-19.

Thanks to Leonid Nilva for feedback.

Thanks to Mark Seneski for thoroughly reviewing my code, catching some of my 
slips from best practice, and prompting me to finally get around to sizing the 
table using prime numbers.
Thanks due to Aaron Krowne for his table of prime numbers used to do this.

Thanks to A. B. M. Omar Faruk for spotting the bug in the sample code on the 
web page, where the same key struct was used for insertion into the hashtable, 
and then also for retrieval. Ownership of the key is claimed when it is 
inserted.
